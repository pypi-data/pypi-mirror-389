// Feedback Control Service
// 
// This service provides the procedures to update specific parameters of 
// sensors during the simulation. It could be used to implement an 
// auto adaptive algorithm.
//
// Note: The changes are not directly applied to the sensor. First, the update 
// will be sent to the sensor at the next world update (requested using 
// the `Update` method of the Simulation service). Then, the sensor will be 
// reloaded so that the updated parameter(s) are used for the next output 
// calculation. However, a sensor cannot be reloaded during an ongoing output 
// calculation, it can be reloaded only after the computation is completed.
//
service FeedbackControl {
  // Sends a sensor (camera, lidar, radar) feedback control.
  //
  // Returns a processing Status.
