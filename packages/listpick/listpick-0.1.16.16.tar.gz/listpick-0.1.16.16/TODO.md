# TODO for listpick


> [!IMPORTANT] ASAP
> - [ ] Unify in-app load and command-line input file
> - [ ] Implement default_option_selector and pass the picker options (!!!)
> - [ ] Make sure that all class initialisation variables are returned in the get_function_variables function.
> - [ ] Go through each of the class variables and see which should be held as common in set_function_data
> - [ ] Make input field look better:
>   - [ ] During input
>   - [ ] While being displayed.
> - [ ] Add keys for next page, next sheet, info
> - [ ] Sort out what to do when the width of the columns is less than the terminal.
> - [ ] Sheet states remain the same when switching files.
> - [x] Deal with nan values in xlsx and ods files.
>   - [ ] They are set to empyt strings.
> - [x] Fix special keys not working:
>   - [x] May need to create separate keycodes...
>   - [x] F1-f12
>   - [x] Tab, shift+tab
>   - [x] Delete, shift+delete
>   - [x] Alt+KEY
>   - [x] Arrow keys
> - [x] Add new keycodes to build_help().
> - [ ] Search count is off
> - [x] Cell isn't highlighted properly when cell beginning is offscreen
>   - [x] ~/items.csv
> - [x] Selected column isn't highlighted properly when cell beginning is offscreen
> - [x] Header rows not aligned properly sometimes...
> - [ ] Check leftmost_char after resizing
> - [ ] Kill threads when we exit the picker.
> - [ ] Data locks when data is still being generated. No modifications.
> - [ ] (!!!) Cell cursor value with hidden columns
>   - [ ] The selected column can be a hidden column
>   - [ ] Hide all columns and toggle cell cursor mode. >> Hangs
>   - [ ] Toggle last visible column in cell cursor mode. >> Hangs
> - [ ] Data generation
>   - [ ] Changing directories in lpfman before all cells have loaded throws errors as threads try to operate on files that aren't in the new directory
>     - [ ] Need to terminate threads when Picker.run() exits.
>   - [ ] Keep track of running threads and tasks to do.
>   - [ ] Go to a loading directory > filter > move down the entries. We are brought back to the top. 
>     - [ ] Probably due to calling Picker.initialise_variables() when we get new data.
> - [ ] Allow multiple files to be added with different generation functions.
> - [ ] Use os.get_terminal_size rather than curses getmaxyx
>   - [ ] We have to get the size of a subwindow in a picker... this subwindow needs to call curses.window.getmaxyx...
>     - [ ] notification, 
> - [ ] Fix pane width adjustment in calculate_section_sizes when the panes are bigger than the screen.
> - [ ] Add different pane width options:
>   - [x] proportion
>   - [ ] fixed size
>   - [ ] function
> - [ ] Add alternating header colours so they can be more easily distinguished
> - [ ] Add new opts key
> - [ ] Add option to display empty rows with separator value (e.g., show empty cells with |)
> - [ ] Horizontal scrollbar
> - [ ] Show tasks screen for active jobs, opening application, etc.
> - [ ] Check edit_menu_keys... select all, ...
> - [ ] Problems with empty rows:
>   - [x] Footer isn't displayed
>   - [x] Settings aren't displayed properly.
>   - [ ] Can't change selected column when there are no rows.
> - [x] Add support for macros.
>   [x] ["Key", "Description (for help)", "function"]

>   - [x] Solved by making the picker into a Picker class.
> - [ ] change hidden_columns from set() to list()
> - [ ] make unselectable_indices work with filtering
> - [ ] look at adjustment for cursor position and hidden unselectable indices
> - [ ] each time we pass options it will resort and refilter; add an option to simply load the items that are passed
> - [ ] require_option should skip the prompt if an option has already been given
> - [ ] force option type; show notification to user if option not appropriate
> - [ ] add the ability to disable options for:

>   - [x] edit cell
>   - [ ] sort
>   - [ ] visual selection
>   - [ ] disable visual selection when # is greater than max_selected
>   - [ ] NOTIFICATIONS
>   - [ ] OPTIONS
> - [ ] Colours
>   - [ ] Redo colours
>   - [ ] pass colours to list_picker in a more intuitive way
>   - [ ] complete get_colours loop
>   - [?] we have arbitrarily set application colours to be 0-50, notification 50-100 and help 100-150
>   - [x] Redo the definitions so that only the key differences are redone in help, notification and options colours for each of the themes.
> - [ ] make infobox variable in size and position 
> - [ ] break draw_screen() into functions
> - [ ] input_field
>      - [ ] implement readline keybinds

>          - [x] ctrl-g, ctrl-c
>          - [x] alt-Backspace
>          - [ ] alt-.
>      - [x] implement kill ring
>      - [x] path completion with tab
>      - [x] history support
>      - [x] add variable max display length
>      - [x] Fix variable x,y position
>   - [ ] Add auto-complete for:
>     - [x] A given word list

>       - [x] %time
>       - [x] %date
>     - [x] Formulae:
>       - [x] $SUM
>       - [x] $SUMPRODUCT
>     - [ ] Settings input bar list
>   - [x] Allow autocomplete not at the beginning of the string
>   - [ ] A bug when doing autocompleting when cursor!=0
>   - [x] Add auto-complete popup list.
> - [ ] Highlights
>   - [ ] (!!!) there is a difference between search matches and highlights because the highlights operate on what is displayed
>     - [ ]  - e.g., wmv$ shows no matches but --3 wmv$ shows matches
>     - [ ]  - e.g., --2 wmv$ shows matches but no highlights
>     - [ ]  - e.g., searching '1 8' cycles through ten matches but highlights 100 lines (every line that has a 1 or an 8)
>      - [?] allow visual matches with searches?
>      - [?] hide highlights across fields?
>      - [?] e.g., mkv$ shows no highlights but does show match
> - [ ] Pipe
>   - [ ] if no items are selected pipe cursor to command
> - [x] Redo keybinds
>   - [x]  n/N search next/prev
>   - [x] (!!!) allow key remappings; have a dictionary to remap
>      - [ ] escape should close option selections and notifications
>   - [x] Add keybind to focus on next (visible) column
> - [ ] (?) adjust default column width based on current page?
> - [ ] Need to set environment variables somehow.
>   - [x] cwd
> - [ ] Sort:
>   - [ ] Make time sort work with formats like: 
>     - [ ] '42 min 40 s'
> - [ ] Add no-select mode which will look better for notifications, options and menus
> - [ ] Unify in-app load and command-line input file
> - [ ] Create list of errors encountered when generating data and output to file if user requests...
> - [x] Add different options for different rows.
>   - Examples:
>     - Run dir selector before asking for string and then use that string as the base for the input_field
>     - Select from given options.
>     - Reject option if it doesn't meet certain criteria
>     - Name the options field
>     - 
>   - [ ] list of dicts
>     - [ ] dicts should specify:
>      - [ ] 
> - [ ] If highlights are off we should still see inverted search highlights.
> - [ ] Resizing of options select should redraw the screen. Implement refresh loop.
> - [ ] Add return value to distinguish between "back" ("h") and "exit" ("q")
> - [ ] Add a crashlog. 
>   - [ ] Anonymised crashlog
> - [ ] Add a cursor-steady mode to complement the existing cursor-follow mode
>   - [ ] Follow index vs follow entry?
>   - [ ] Follow-entry mode: You are watching a download at the top of the list. It finishes and takes you to the bottom of the download list.
>   - [ ] Follow-entry mode (not ideal): You are visually selecting the active and paused downloads but when the cursor is on one of the active downloads you are suddenly cast down the list when it finishes.
> - [x] Footer string doesn't load immediately loading a Picker
> - [x] Use hjkl for movement, rather than h/l for back/accecpt.
> - [ ] Increase max_column_width when the full width of the terminal is not taken up but the data of some columns is truncated.
> - [ ] Numerical sort has blank rows at the top when we sort by ascending order.
>   - [ ] Is this the way it should be??? They will be sorted to the top in either asc. or desc. ...
> - Settings:
>  - settings are split by spaces so we currently can't do, say, 'th 3', because it separates 'th' from '3' and applies them separately.
>   - [ ] Add list of commands to word autocomplete.
> - [x] Scroll to left/right when selected column moves off screen.
>   - [ ] Buggy when we have hidden columns.
> - [ ] Should H/L not only scroll to the end but also select the first/last column?
>   - [ ] Should we allow a key to perform more than one function?
> - [ ] Cell-wise listpick
>   - [x] Cell-wise selection toggle
>   - [x] Cell-wise visual selection and deselection
>     - [x] remember column when visual selection starts
>   - [x] Select all and select none.
>   - [x] Display each highlighted cell in draw_screen()
>   - [x] Copy cell-wise
>   - [x] Paste cell-wise
>   - [ ] Delete cell-wise
>   - [ ] Draw highlights before cell cursor
>    - [ ] Should there be different highlight 'levels' ?
> - [x] Separate sort_column from a new selected_column argument. They really should be two different things.
> - [ ] Peformance improvements:
>   - [ ] Ensure that we only get_column_widths when we need to since this is resource intensive:
>     - [ ] When we change the max_column_width
> - [ ] Add data refreshing modes:
>   - [ ] Replace
>   - [ ] Append
>   - [ ] Union
>   - [ ] Intersection
> - [ ] Add a broader editor_picker option which enables/disables add/remove columns in the settings.
> - [ ] If no -t type argument is given then guess filetype.
> - [ ] Add row selection using 'V'--select all cells in a row.
> - [ ] Add option for those who don't use a nerdfont.
>   - [ ] refreshing symbol, pin cursor symbol,
> - [x] Add info page.
> - [ ] Handle multiple files
>   - [x] Display 'open' files in footer
>   - [x] Open multiple files with file_picker
>   - [x] Switch between 'open' files
>   - [ ] Handle unsaved files.
>   - [x] Remember state when switching between files.
>     - [x] Selections
>  - [ ] Add support in the alternate footers
>  - [ ] Add symbol in footer list to show if file has been edited or is unsaved
> - [x] Handle files with multiple sheets.
>  - [ ] Add support in the alternate footers
> - [x] Support opening multiple files from the command line.
> - [ ] In initialise_variables(), make cursor- and selection-tracking optional
> - [ ] Add temporary notifications

> [!Bug] Bugs
> - [ ] fix resizing when input field active
>   - [ ] Remap resize in keymaps and return "refresh" in the opts 
> - [ ] Visual selection
>   - [ ] when visually selecting sometimes single rows above are highlighted (though not selected)
> - [ ] weird alignment problem with certain characters
>   - [x] Chinese characters
>   - [x] Korean characters
>   - [x] Japanese characters
>   - [ ] Problems with the following:
>       - ： 
> - [ ] moving columns:
>   - ruins highlighting
>   - is not preserved in function_data
>   - implement indexed_columns
>   - will have to put header in function_data to track location of fields
> - [ ] regexp and field entry errors
>   - [x] filter
>   - [x] "--1 error .*" doesn't work but ".* --1" error does
>   - [ ] search
>   - [ ] highlights
>   - [x] when +,* is added to the filter it errors out
>   - [ ] some capture groups don't work [^0]
>   - [ ] should general search be cell-wise?
>   - [ ] option to search visible columns only
>   - [ ] [^\s]* finds the right matches but doesn't highlight them properly.
> - [ ] Visual selection: start visual selection on row 100. List_picker refreshes and there are only 10 rows with the applied filter. End visual selection on row 2. Crash
> - [ ] blinking cursor character shows after opening nvim and returning to listpicker
>    - Not sure if this can be avoided. 
>       - In alacritty it always shows the cursor
>       - In kitty it shows only after opening nvim
> - [x] The backspace key is not registered in the input field when the cursor is in the options box. The keys work in the main application and in help but not in the options box list_picker...
>   -  [x] No idea why but the keycode for backspace is 263 in the main window but in curses.newwin the backspace keycode is 127
>   - Had to set submenu_win.keypad(True) for the submenu window as well as the main window. It doesn't seem to inherit the parent window's properties
> - [x] Last character on header string doesn't show if header value for that cell is longer than all entries in that column
>   - [x] have to +1 to total visible column width
> - [x] If require option is given and the box is empty then we should exit the input field without returning the index
> - [ ] Sometimes the variables from one menu remain in the other in aria2tui... weird
> - [ ] When loading a pickled file from aria2tui we get a crash because there are more lines in the data.
>   - [ ] Reset other variables when loading data?
> - [x] (!!!) When search has no matches it still shows the previous matched search numbers ([3/8])
> - [ ] When the number of items in the infobox display is longer than the infobox there is a crash.
>   - [x] Limited the number of lines displayed so that there will not be a crash, but still not entirely sure why it happens.
> - [x] Resizing when footer is hidden causes issues.
>   - [x] This is largely fixed but still sometimes when the number of lines is decreased there is still an issue and even occasionally we get a crash.
>   - [x] Fixed. No resizing issues for several versions.
>   - [x] The issue was not setting the number of lines correctly after key=curses.KEY_RESIZE was detected.
> - [ ] Importing IPython causes errors with registering keys.
>   - [x] Limited the damage by only importing when the edit_python key is pressed.
> - [ ] When adding torrents/opening nvim sometimes there are still artifacts after we return to the Picker.
>  - [x] Add a clear_on_start flag to Picker(), if not true then simply erase
> - [ ] Sometimes the scroll wheel scrolls up in the terminal.
> - [x] nvim shows search error sometimes
>   - [x] Removed the search. It seems unnecessary.
>   - [x] nvim shada on
> - [x] Visual select still shows selected on empty list
> - [x] Extremely slow when searching a large number of rows...
>   - [x] Fixed. Was caused by adding every matched index to the highlights.
> - [ ] Problem with resizing after entering ipython interactive mode.
> - [ ] Adding row when there are no columns causes a crash.
> - [ ] centre_in_cols doesn't seem to centre the values properly. They are to the left of the cell.
> - [ ] Crash when we delete the last row
> - [ ] (***) Refreshing when we have selected cells that are not in the refreshed data causes crash.
> - [ ] Crash when editing a cell and adding newlines (from nvim)
> - [x] Pink flash when loading. Likely due to colour redefinitions before picker actually loads.
>   - [x] Fixed. Created splashscreen class function which will be displayed after the colours are defined.
> - [ ] If the longest string in a column is the header string and show_header=False, then get_column_widths still calculates based on the header string length.
> - [x] Rows sometimes adjust position a second time after switching files.
>   - [x] Was due to the height of the footer being set only at the end of the Footer.draw() method. Created a new Footer.adjust_sizes() method which is run at the start of the draw_screen() loop.
> - [x] Issues switching between open files when some of them have been closed:
>   - [x] Wrong data for some files.
>   - [x] Some can't be switched to...
>   - [x] Fixed.
> - [x] Highlighted cells display padded cell string when it should not be padded.
> - [x] When there is an active search it overlaps the last row.
>   - [x] Update footer height when there is a search query.
> - [x] Header columns are not aligned with long header values.
>   - [x] Done: 2025-08-27
> - [ ] Pressing page forward/page back in an empty picker changes the index in the footer from 0 to 1...
