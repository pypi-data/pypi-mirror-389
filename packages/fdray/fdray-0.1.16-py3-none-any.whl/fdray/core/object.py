"""3D objects and operations for ray tracing.

This module provides a collection of 3D object classes for ray tracing with POV-Ray.
Objects can be combined using CSG operations (union, intersection, difference)
and can be transformed (scale, rotate, translate). Each object can also have
attributes like color, texture, or other POV-Ray specific properties.

The module structure follows these principles:

1. All objects inherit from the base class Object
2. CSG operations are implemented as special object classes
3. Convenience methods are provided for common transformations
4. String representation of objects matches POV-Ray SDL syntax
