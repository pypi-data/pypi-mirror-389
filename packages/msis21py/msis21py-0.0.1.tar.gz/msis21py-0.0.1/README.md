# NRLMSIS-2.1 Python Wrapper
`msis21py` is a wrapper around the [NRLMSIS-2.1](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/NRLMSIS~2.1/) empirical model.

This repository uses the [NRLMSIS-2.1 model](https://map.nrl.navy.mil/map/pub/nrl/NRLMSIS/NRLMSIS2.1/nrlmsis2.1.tar.gz) as is with Python. 
The integration is achieved by means of a FORTRAN shim ([`msis21shim.f90`](src/msis21fort/msis21shim.f90))
that is compiled into a module using [F2PY](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/index.html). The parameter file `msis21.parm` is automatically
provided at runtime.

## Installation
### From [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/msis21py/)
```sh
pip install msis21py
```
### From [GitHub](https://github.com/sunipkm/msis21py)
```sh
pip install msis21py@git+https://github.com/sunipkm/msis21py
```

## Usage
```py
from msis21py import NrlMsis21, alt_grid
from datetime import datetime, UTC
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Instantiate the model
msis = NrlMsis21()
# Note: msis is a singleton (thread safety with FORTRAN)
# Evaluate the model
ds = msis.evaluate(
    datetime(2022, 3, 12, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=UTC),
    40, -70,
    alt_grid()
)

# ds is an xarray Dataset
# Plot neutral temperature profile
ds.Tn.plot(y='alt_km')
plt.show()
```

## Output Dataset Format
- Coordinates
  - Altitude (`alt_km`): Altitude in *km*
- Data Variables (as a function of altitude)
  - Densities of O, O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, H, He, Ar, N, Anomalous O, and NO in *cm*<sup>-3</sup>
  - Neutral temperature (`Tn`) in *K*
  - Mass density (`mden`) in *g cm*<sup>-3</sup>
- Attributes
  - `settings`: JSON string of settings (`msis21py.Settings`) used to evaluate the model.
  - `date`: ISO formatted date and time for which the model was evaluated.
  - `lat` and `lon`: Latitude and longitude for where the model was evaluated.
  - Additional attributes are provided as JSON dictionaries containing a `value`, its `unit`, a longer name (`long_name`) and an associated `description`, if available.

The dataset is NetCDF4 compatible.
