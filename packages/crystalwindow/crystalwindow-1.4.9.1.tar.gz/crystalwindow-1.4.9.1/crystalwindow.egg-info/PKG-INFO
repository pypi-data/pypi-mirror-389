CRYSTALWINDOW!!!

A tiny but mighty Pygame framework that gives u a full window system, rendering, and GUI power â€” all packed into one file.
No setup pain. No folder chaos. Just import, and there, instant window.

*  Quick Start
pip install crystalwindow

Then in ur Python script:

from CrystalWindow import Window

# create window
win = Window(800, 600, "My Cool Game")

# main loop
while win.running:
    win.check_events()
    win.fill((0, 0, 50))
    win.update()

Thatâ€™s it. Run it, and boom â€” instant working window.

Features

*  Built-in window manager
*  Built-in image & icon loader (with default base64 logo)
*  File-safe startup (even inside PyInstaller)
*  Works offline â€” no extra libs
*  Minimal and clean syntax

It has a Default Logo

The file includes a variable named DEFAULT_LOGO_BASE64 â€” a lil encoded PNG used when no icon is found.

Use it like: Window(800, 600, "My Window", icon=MyIcon.png)

THERE WE GO â€” u can show it, set it as a window icon, or meme it if u want.

Example Integration

You can use it as part of ur project (like a game, an editor, or a tool):

from CrystalWindow import Window

win = Window(800, 600, "My Window", icon=MyIcon.png)

while win.running:
    win.check_events()
    win.fill((10, 10, 20))
    win.update()
