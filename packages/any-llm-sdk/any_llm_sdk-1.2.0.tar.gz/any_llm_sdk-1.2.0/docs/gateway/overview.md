# Gateway Overview

## What is any-llm gateway?

any-llm gateway is a FastAPI-based proxy server that adds production-grade budget enforcement, API key management, and usage analytics on top of any-llm's multi-provider foundation. It sits between your applications and LLM providers, giving you complete control over costs, access, and observability.

## Why use the gateway?

Managing LLM costs and access at scale is challenging. Give users unrestricted access and you risk runaway costs. Lock it down too much and you slow down innovation. any-llm gateway solves this by providing:

- **Cost Control**: Set budgets that automatically enforce or track spending limits
- **Access Management**: Issue, revoke, and monitor API keys generated for user access without exposing provider credentials
- **Complete Visibility**: Track every request with full token counts, costs, and metadata
- **Production-Ready**: Deploy with Docker and Postgres, Kubernetes-ready

## How it works

The gateway exposes an OpenAI-compatible Completions API that works with any supported provider. Your applications connect to the gateway instead of directly to LLM providers, and the gateway handles:

- **Authentication**: Validates requests using master keys or virtual API keys
- **Budget Enforcement**: Checks spending limits before forwarding requests
- **Provider Routing**: Routes requests to the appropriate LLM provider using the `provider:model` format (e.g., `openai:gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`)
- **Usage Tracking**: Logs all requests with token counts and costs
- **Streaming Support**: Handles streaming responses with automatic token tracking

## Key Features

### Smart Budget Management

Create shared budget tiers with automatic daily, weekly, or monthly resets. Budgets can be:

- **Shared across multiple users** - Perfect for team or organization-wide limits
- **Automatically enforced** - Requests are rejected when budgets are exceeded
- **Tracking-only mode** - Monitor spending without blocking requests
- **Auto-resetting** - No manual intervention required for recurring budgets

### Flexible API Key System

Choose between two authentication patterns:

**Master Key Authentication**
* Ideal for trusted services and internal tools
* Full access to all gateway features

**Virtual API Keys**
* Create scoped keys with fine-grained control
* Set expiration dates for time-limited access
* Associate with users for spend tracking
* Add custom metadata for tracking
* Activate, deactivate, or revoke on demand

### Complete Usage Analytics

Every request is logged with comprehensive details:

- Full token counts (prompt, completion, total)
- Per-request costs based on admin-configured per-token pricing
- Request metadata and timestamps
- User and API key attribution

Track spending per user, view detailed usage history, and get the observability you need for cost attribution and chargebacks.

### Production-Ready Deployment

- **Quick Start**: Deploy with Docker in minutes
- **Flexible Configuration**: Configure via YAML or environment variables
- **Database**: Designed for PostgreSQL
- **Kubernetes Ready**: Built-in liveness and readiness probes

### Performance Impact
The gateway adds minimal latency (<50ms) to requests while providing complete observability.
