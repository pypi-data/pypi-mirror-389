## 📖 Introduction

**ThermoHi** is a small, research-oriented Python package for thermal kinetic analysis  
and data visualization, designed for TG/DTG analysis in polymer and biomass systems.  
It supports model-free methods such as **FWO**, **KAS**, **Starink**, and **Friedman**,  
with clean APIs and ready-to-plot results.
> An example file (`example.py`) is included to illustrate the usage of ThermoHi's main functionalities.

## 🔬 Planned Features
Future versions of **ThermoHi** will include:

- [ ] Support for importing experimental data directly from `.csv` or `.xlsx` files (via `pandas`)
- [ ] Unified plotting style for publication-ready figures (Matplotlib themes)
- [ ] Implementation of the **Vyazovkin method**
- [ ] Exporting results as `.csv`
- [ ] Directly read TG/DTG experimental data and automatically extract corresponding `(T, β, dα/dT)` values based on user-selected α
