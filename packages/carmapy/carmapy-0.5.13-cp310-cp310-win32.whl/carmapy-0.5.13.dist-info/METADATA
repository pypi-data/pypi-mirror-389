CARMApy is a python wrapper of the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), originally developed by Turco et al. (1979) and Toon et al. (1979).  carmapy specifically wraps ExoCARMA, a version of CARMA developed by Gao et al. (2018) and Powell et al. (2018) to model clouds on exoplanets.  Note that this repository is in beta.
