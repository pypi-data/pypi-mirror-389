LazyCook is an advanced multi-agent AI assistant that brings the power of Google’s Gemini models into a self-contained, autonomous Python application. It is designed for developers, researchers, and productivity enthusiasts who want an intelligent assistant that can chat, analyze, manage documents, track tasks, and evaluate quality — all locally. LazyCook operates on a four-agent architecture, where each agent specializes in a distinct stage of AI reasoning. Together, they create a loop of generation, analysis, optimization, and validation, resulting in high-quality, context-aware, and factually accurate responses. It maintains a persistent memory of user conversations, supports document uploads for contextual reference, and features real-time performance tracking, logging, and export tools
