# Release Template

This is an example of how to create a RELEASE.md file for publishing to PyPI.

**Important**: Only add RELEASE.md in your PR when you want to trigger a release.

## Format

```markdown
---
release type: patch | minor | major
---

Description of the changes in this release.
Can be multiple lines and paragraphs.

- Bullet points work too
- List your changes clearly
```

## Release Types

- **patch** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1): Bug fixes, small improvements
- **minor** (0.1.0 → 0.2.0): New features, backwards compatible
- **major** (0.1.0 → 1.0.0): Breaking changes

## Examples

### Patch Release (Bug Fix)

```markdown
---
release type: patch
---

Fix asset version comparison for None values

- Handle None values correctly in version comparison
- Add test coverage for edge cases
- Update documentation
```

### Minor Release (New Feature)

```markdown
---
release type: minor
---

Add support for lazy props evaluation

This release adds lazy props, allowing expensive computations
to be deferred until they're actually needed.

- Implement lazy prop wrapper
- Only evaluate when requested in partial reloads
- Add documentation and examples
- 100% test coverage
```

### Major Release (Breaking Change)

```markdown
---
release type: major
---

Refactor to use inertia.fastapi namespace

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Imports have changed from `inertia` to `inertia.fastapi`

Migration guide:
- Old: `from inertia import InertiaDep`
- New: `from inertia.fastapi import InertiaDep`

This change allows us to support multiple frameworks cleanly.
```

## How to Release

1. Create your PR with changes
2. Add a `RELEASE.md` file with the format above
3. The PR check workflow will validate it
4. When merged to main, autopub will:
   - Update version in pyproject.toml
   - Create a GitHub release with notes
   - Build the package
   - Publish to PyPI
   - Update CHANGELOG.md

## What Happens Automatically

- ✅ Version bump in pyproject.toml
- ✅ Git tag created
- ✅ GitHub Release created with notes
- ✅ Package built and published to PyPI
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md updated
- ✅ RELEASE.md removed after publishing
