# opensees-copilot

> Minimal placeholder to reserve the package name while the full OpenSees Copilot is in development.

This package currently provides a tiny CLI, `opsc`, which prints the version and a roadmap link.

## Install

```bash
pip install opensees-copilot
```

## CLI

```bash
opsc
```

## Notes

- This is a legitimate placeholder (not name squatting): it includes a README, license, simple CLI, and versioning.
- Future releases will add APIs and real functionality around OpenSees/OpenSeesPy workflows.
