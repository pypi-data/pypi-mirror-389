# Raphson Music Player

Web-based social music player for communities (hacker spaces, maker spaces).

What makes this different from other music players? It is designed around listening with groups. Instead of playing a single playlist, this music player allows enabling many playlists from different people. Tracks are shuffled from multiple playlists into a single queue. No more arguing about which music to play, everyone's music get played.

An additional benefit of this is music discovery, even when you're listening solo you might like to mix up your own music with someone else's.
