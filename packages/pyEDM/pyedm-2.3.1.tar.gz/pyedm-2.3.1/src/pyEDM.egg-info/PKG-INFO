## Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM)
---
This package provides a Python/Pandas DataFrame toolset for [EDM analysis](http://deepeco.ucsd.edu/nonlinear-dynamics-research/edm/ "EDM @ Sugihara Lab").  Introduction and documentation are are avilable [online](https://sugiharalab.github.io/EDM_Documentation/ "EDM Docs"), or in the package [API docs](https://github.com/SugiharaLab/pyEDM/blob/master/doc/pyEDM.pdf "pyEDM API"). A Jupyter notebook interface is available at [jpyEDM](https://github.com/SugiharaLab/jpyEDM#empirical-dynamic-modeling-edm-jupyter-notebook).

Functionality includes:
* Simplex projection ([Sugihara and May 1990](https://www.nature.com/articles/344734a0))
* Sequential Locally Weighted Global Linear Maps (S-Map) ([Sugihara 1994](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.1994.0106))
* Multivariate embeddings ([Dixon et. al. 1999](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/283/5407/1528))
* Convergent cross mapping ([Sugihara et. al. 2012](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6106/496))
* Multiview embedding ([Ye and Sugihara 2016](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6302/922))
