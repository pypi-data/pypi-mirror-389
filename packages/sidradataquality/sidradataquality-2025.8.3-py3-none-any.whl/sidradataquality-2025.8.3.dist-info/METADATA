# Introduction 
This project contains the Python SDK for Data Quality validations. 

This SDK contains methods intended to use from Jupyter notebooks as part of Sidra data quality validations. Most methods will require great_expectations and could be implemented using great_expectations only, but the SDK implementation will be more friendly and easy to use
