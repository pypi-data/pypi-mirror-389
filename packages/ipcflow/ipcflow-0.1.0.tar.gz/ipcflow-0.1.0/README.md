# IPCflow

**IPCflow** is a lightweight Python package for connecting programs written in different languages through simple, message-based communication.

It lets you **call Python functions directly from another process or language** — for example, from Node.js, Go, or C++ — without using network sockets or external servers allowing requests and responses to flow naturally between environments.

The goal of **IPCflow** is to make cross-language function calls fast, predictable, and easy to integrate into existing systems. It’s designed for developers who want the power of Python inside other runtimes, with minimal setup and zero dependencies.

## Key Ideas

- Simple: no network setup
- Language-agnostic: works with any language
- Lightweight: zero dependencies, fast startup
- Extensible: expose your own Python functions easily

## Example Use Cases

- Calling Python logic from Node.js or Go
- Embedding machine learning models into other runtimes
- Automating workflows or scripts with Python from a larger system
- Building quick integrations between heterogeneous services

**IPCflow** is currently in development — documentation and examples coming soon.
