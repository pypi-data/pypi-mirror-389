# repsim (Python)

**Representational Similarity Metrics for Machine Learning and Neuroscience**

`repsim` provides efficient implementations of representational similarity measures  using a C++17 backend via **pybind11** and  **Eigen**, whose vendored version is included under `third_party/eigen` for reproducible builds. It parallels the R package *repsim*, ensuring consistency across environments.
