# Installation of mfoutparser

## Using pip (RECOMMENDED)

mfoutparser can be installed using the pip package manager:

```
pip install mfoutparser
```

## Using setuptools

mfoutparser can be installed using python's setuptools. Ensure that you understand how setuptools installations work so mfoutparser (and dependencies) are not installed in your operating system's python directory.

First, clone the github repo using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/agpalmeriii/mfoutparser mfoutparser
```

Then `cd` into the downloaded directory and install mfoutparser using the following command:

```
cd mfoutparser && python setup.py install
```
