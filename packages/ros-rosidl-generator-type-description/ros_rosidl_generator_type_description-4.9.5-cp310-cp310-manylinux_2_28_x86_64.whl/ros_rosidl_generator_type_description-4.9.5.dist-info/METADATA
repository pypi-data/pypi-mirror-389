# rosidl_generator_type_description

This generator serializes ROS 2 interface descriptions (message, service, action) to a common format and uses SHA256 to hash that representation into a unique hash for each type.

The SHA256 hashes generated by this package must match those generated by `rcl_calculate_type_hash`. The `.json` files generated must, therefore, match the result of `rcl_type_description_to_hashable_json`.

## Generated files

This generator creates one output file per interface, `interface_name.json`.

This file follows the schema [`HashedTypedDescription`](./resource/HashedTypeDescription.schema.json).
It contains a tree of hashes for the top-level interface and any of its generated subinterfaces (such as request and response messages for a service), as well as fully-expanded descriptions of the interface type.
This description is a representation of `type_description_interfaces/msg/TypeDescription`, including all recursively-referenced types.
This way, dependent descriptions may use this interface and recurse no further to know the full set of referenced types it needs to know about.
