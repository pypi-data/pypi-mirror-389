### What is feinsum?

*Feinsum*, short for Fast-Einstein Summations, provides tools for managing
databases of code-transformations on *Batched Einstein Summations*. Unlike
typical computational primitive libraries that ship optimized computational
kernel in source or binary form, *feinsum* records code-transformations from
a trivial schedule, resulting in relative savings from not having to flush the
operands to the DRAM.
