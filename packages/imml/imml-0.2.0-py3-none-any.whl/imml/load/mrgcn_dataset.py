class MRGCNDataset(Dataset):
    r"""
    This class provides a `torch.utils.data.Dataset` implementation for handling multi-modal datasets with `MRGCN`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Xs : list of array-likes objects
        - Xs length: n_mods
        - Xs[i] shape: (n_samples, n_features_i)

        A list of different modalities.
    transform : list of callable, defult=None
        A list of functions or transformations to apply to each sample in the dataset.

    Example
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import torch
    >>> from imml.load import MRGCNDataset
    >>> Xs = [torch.from_numpy(np.random.default_rng(42).random((20, 10))) for i in range(3)]
    >>> train_data = MRGCNDataset(Xs=Xs)
