Description: This package provides a mongodb server stub setup for python doctests.

        ======
        
        This package provides a mongo database server testing stub. You can simply
        setup such a mongodb stub server in a doctest like::
        
          import doctest
          import unittest
        
          import m01.stub.testing
        
          def test_suite():
              return unittest.TestSuite((
                  doctest.DocFileSuite('README.txt',
                      setUp=m01.stub.testing.setUpStubMongo,
                      tearDown=m01.stub.testing.tearDownStubMongo,
                      optionflags=doctest.NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE|doctest.ELLIPSIS),
                  ))
        
        
          if __name__ == '__main__':
              unittest.main(defaultTest='test_suite')
        
        The m01/stub/testing.py module provides a start and stop method which will
        download, install, start and stop a mongodb server. All this is done in the
        m01/stub/testing/sandbox folder. Everytime a test get started the mongodb/data
        folder get removed and a fresh empty database get used.
        
        Note: Also see the zipFolder and unZipFile methods in testing.py which allows
        you to setup mongodb data and before remove them store them as a zip file
        for a next test run. Such a zipped data folder can get used in another test run
        by set the path to the zip file as dataSource argument. Also check the
        m01.mongo package for more test use cases.
        
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        Let's use the pymongo package for test our mongodb server stub setup. Note we
        use a different port for our stub server setup (45017 instead of 27017):
        
          >>> from pprint import pprint
          >>> from pymongo.periodic_executor import _shutdown_executors
          >>> import m01.stub.testing
        
        Let's test our mongodb stub setup:
        
          >>> conn = m01.stub.testing.getTestClient()
        
          >>> pprint(conn.server_info())
          {...,
           ...'ok': 1.0,
           ...}
        
          >>> sorted([i for i in conn.list_database_names()])
          [...'admin', ...'local']
        
        setup an index:
        
          >>> print(conn.m01_stub_testing.test.collection.create_index('dummy'))
          dummy_1
        
        add an object:
        
          >>> result = conn.m01_stub_testing.test.insert_one({'__name__': 'foo', 'dummy': 'object'})
          >>> 'InsertOneResult' in str(result)
          True
        
          >>> _id = result.inserted_id
          >>> _id
          ObjectId('...')
        
        remove them:
        
          >>> result = conn.m01_stub_testing.test.delete_one({'_id': _id})
          >>> 'DeleteResult' in str(result)
          True
        
          >>> result.acknowledged
          True
        
          >> m01.fake.pprint(result.raw_result)
          {'n': 1, 'ok': 1.0}
        
          >>> result.deleted_count
          1
        
        and check the databsae names again:
        
          >>> sorted([i for i in list(conn.list_database_names())])
          [...'admin', ...'local', ...'m01_stub_testing']
        
        Let's drop the database:
        
          >>> conn.drop_database("m01_stub_testing")
          >>> sorted([i for i in conn.list_database_names()])
          [...'admin', ...'local']
        
        
        Close client:
        
          >>> conn.close()
          >>> _shutdown_executors()

        -------------------
        
        - feature; improve start and stop stub mongodb server. Close subprocess after
          stop the stub server.
        
        
        
        3.13.1 (2025-07-10)

          released. We will try different urls for windows 64 bit versions.
          Note, you will probably run into a MemoryError during download if your try
          to download a large mongodb release with a non 64 bit python version.
        
        
        3.0.1 (2015-11-10)
        ------------------

        - pymongo > 3.0.0 compatibility. Support pymongo > 3.0.0 use MongoClient instead
          of Connection etc. Use 3.0.0 as package version and reflect pymongo > 3.0.0
          compatibility.
        
        - switch default mongodb download version to 3.0.6
        
        - improve shutdown mongodb server, cleanup client weakref

        - update default mongodb version to 2.4.10
        
        - changed default mongodb allocation space from 100MB to 10MB for faster server
          startup
        
        - bugfix: startup check didn't fit and it was forced 16 times to sleep for one
          second. Fix server status ok check from '1.0' to 1
        
        
        0.5.7 (2012-12-10)

        0.5.6 (2012-12-09)
        ------------------
        
        - switch to mongodb 2.2.2 and support version property in startMongoServer
        
        
        0.5.5 (2012-11-18)
        ------------------
        
        - bugfix: fix start and stop observer methods. Replaced javascript calls with
          simpler pymongo connectionn calls for startup check and shutdown

          process
        
        - bugfix: mongo results comes back with a line break
        
        - bugfix: string cmd *only* on Windows

          "options" argument: it has to be a list now
        
        - to stop mongodb, we are now sending a command through the "mongo shell",
          we do not use a pid file any more, all we need is the port, which we keep
          in a global
        
        - we are now repeatedly checking till the mongodb server starts up and
          answers to an admin query
        
        - move flexible sub-version tests to accomodate OpenBSD
        
        - fixed detection of being on a Mac for mongo db download for tests
        
        - added MANIFEST.in file
