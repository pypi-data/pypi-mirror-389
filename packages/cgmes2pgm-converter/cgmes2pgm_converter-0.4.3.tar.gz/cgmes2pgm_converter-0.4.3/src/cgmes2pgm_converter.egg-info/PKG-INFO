# CGMES2PGM-Converter

`cgmes2pgm_converter` provides a library to convert Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES) datasets to [PowerGridModel](https://github.com/PowerGridModel/power-grid-model) format.
It was designed to apply the PGM State Estimation on a CGMES dataset.
The CGMES dataset is fetched from a SPARQL endpoint and converted to a PGM dataset.
This converter works with CGMES 3.0 / CIM 100 datasets, as well as CGMES 2.4 / CIM 16 datasets.

Methods to substitute additional measurements are included as well to improve state estimation (e.g. passive nodes).
[cgmes2pgm_suite](https://github.com/SOPTIM/cgmes2pgm_suite) provides additional tools for working with CGMES and PGM.

## Getting Started

The package can be installed from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install cgmes2pgm_converter
```

### Set up the CGMES-Model

The CGMES-Model needs to be imported as a dataset into a triplestore providing a SPARQL endpoint (e.g. [Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/)).

Currently, the CGMES model needs to be stored in the default graph of the dataset. This approach may be updated in future versions.

### Conversion

```python
from cgmes2pgm_converter import CgmesToPgmConverter, CgmesDataset

dataset = CgmesDataset(
    base_url="http://localhost:3030/dataset_name",
    cim_namespace="http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#", # for CGMES 2.4
    # "http://iec.ch/TC57/CIM100#", # for CGMES 3.0
)

converter = CgmesToPgmConverter(datasource=dataset)
input_data, extra_info = converter.convert()
```

See [cgmes2pgm_suite](https://github.com/SOPTIM/cgmes2pgm_suite) for an complete example of how to use the converter.

## Supported CGMES Classes

The following list of CGMES classes is supported by the converter:

- All Branches (ACLineSegment, EquivalentBranch)
- Links (Switch, Breaker, Disconnector)
- Transformers (2-Winding, 3-Winding)
  - RatioTapchanger
  - PhaseTapChangerTabular
  - PhaseTapChangerLinear, -Symmetrical, -Asymmetrical
- Measurements (P, Q, U, I\*)
- Generators & Loads
  - SynchronousMachine, AsynchronousMachine
  - ExternalNEtworkInjection
  - EnergyConsumer
  - StaticVarCompensator
- Shunts (Linear-, NonlinearShuntCompensator)
- DC Components
  - CsConverter, VsConverter
  - Replaced by loads since PGM does not support DC Components

\* Used to create Q-measurements
