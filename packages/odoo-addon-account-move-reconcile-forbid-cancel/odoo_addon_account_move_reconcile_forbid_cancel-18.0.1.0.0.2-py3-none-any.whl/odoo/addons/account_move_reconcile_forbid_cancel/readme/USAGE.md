To use this module, you need to:

1.  Go to *Invoicing \> Customers \> Invoices*
2.  Access an invoice that has a payment.
3.  Click on the 'Reset to Draft' button and you will get an error
    message to prevent you from resetting the invoice to draft state
    because it has already an associated payment.
