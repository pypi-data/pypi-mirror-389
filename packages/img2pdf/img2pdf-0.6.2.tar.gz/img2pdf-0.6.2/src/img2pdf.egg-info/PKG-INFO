         Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
        
        
          This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
        the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
        License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
        
          0. Additional Definitions.
        
          As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
        General Public License.
        
          "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
        other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
        
          An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
        by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
        Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
        of using an interface provided by the Library.
        
          A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
        Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
        with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
        Version".
        
          The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
        Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
        for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
        based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
        
          The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
        object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
        and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
        Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
        
          1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        
          You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
        without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        
          2. Conveying Modified Versions.
        
          If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
        facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
        that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
        facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
        version:
        
           a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
           ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
           function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
           whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
        
           b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
           this License applicable to that copy.
        
          3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
        
          The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
        a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
        code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
        layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
        (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
        
           a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
           Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
           covered by this License.
        
           b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
           document.
        
          4. Combined Works.
        
          You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
        taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
        portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
        engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
        the following:
        
           a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
           the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
           covered by this License.
        
           b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
           document.
        
           c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
           execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
           these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
           copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
        
           d) Do one of the following:
        
               0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
               License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
               suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
               recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
               the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
               manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
               Corresponding Source.
        
               1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
               Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
               a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
               system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
               of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
               Version.
        
           e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
           be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
           GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
           necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
           Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
           Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
           you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
           the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
           Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
           Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
           for conveying Corresponding Source.)
        
          5. Combined Libraries.
        
          You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
        Library side by side in a single library together with other library
        facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
        License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
        choice, if you do both of the following:
        
           a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
           on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
           conveyed under the terms of this License.
        
           b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
           is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
           accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
        
          6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
        
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
        versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
        differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
        Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
        applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
        conditions either of that published version or of any later version
        published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
        received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        
          If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
        whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
        apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
        permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
        Library.

img2pdf
=======

Lossless conversion of raster images to PDF. You should use img2pdf if your
priorities are (in this order):

 1. **always lossless**: the image embedded in the PDF will always have the
    exact same color information for every pixel as the input
 2. **small**: if possible, the difference in filesize between the input image
    and the output PDF will only be the overhead of the PDF container itself
 3. **fast**: if possible, the input image is just pasted into the PDF document
    as-is without any CPU hungry re-encoding of the pixel data

Conventional conversion software (like ImageMagick) would either:

 1. not be lossless because lossy re-encoding to JPEG
 2. not be small because using wasteful flate encoding of raw pixel data
 3. not be fast because input data gets re-encoded

Another advantage of not having to re-encode the input (in most common
situations) is, that img2pdf is able to handle much larger input than other
software, because the raw pixel data never has to be loaded into memory.

The following table shows how img2pdf handles different input depending on the
input file format and image color space.

| Format                                | Colorspace                           | Result        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| JPEG                                  | any                                  | direct        |
| JPEG2000                              | any                                  | direct        |
| PNG (non-interlaced, no transparency) | any                                  | direct        |
| TIFF (CCITT Group 4)                  | 1-bit monochrome                     | direct        |
| JBIG2 (single-page generic coding)    | 1-bit monochrome                     | direct        |
| any                                   | any except CMYK and 1-bit monochrome | PNG Paeth     |
| any                                   | 1-bit monochrome                     | CCITT Group 4 |
| any                                   | CMYK                                 | flate         |

For JPEG, JPEG2000, non-interlaced PNG, TIFF images with CCITT Group 4
encoded data, and JBIG2 with single-page generic coding (e.g. using `jbig2enc`),
img2pdf directly embeds the image data into the PDF without
re-encoding it. It thus treats the PDF format merely as a container format for
the image data. In these cases, img2pdf only increases the filesize by the size
of the PDF container (typically around 500 to 700 bytes). Since data is only
copied and not re-encoded, img2pdf is also typically faster than other
solutions for these input formats.

For all other input types, img2pdf first has to transform the pixel data to
make it compatible with PDF. In most cases, the PNG Paeth filter is applied to
the pixel data. For 1-bit monochrome input, CCITT Group 4 is used instead. Only for
CMYK input no filter is applied before finally applying flate compression.

Usage
-----

The images must be provided as files because img2pdf needs to seek in the file
descriptor.

If no output file is specified with the `-o`/`--output` option, output will be
done to stdout. A typical invocation is:

	$ img2pdf img1.png img2.jpg -o out.pdf

The detailed documentation can be accessed by running:

	$ img2pdf --help

With no command line arguments supplied, img2pdf will read a single image from
standard input and write the resulting PDF to standard output. Here is an
example for how to scan directly to PDF using scanimage(1) from SANE:

	$ scanimage --mode=Color --resolution=300 | pnmtojpeg -quality 90 | img2pdf > scan.pdf

Bugs
----

 - If you find a JPEG, JPEG2000, PNG or CCITT Group 4 encoded TIFF file that,
   when embedded into the PDF cannot be read by the Adobe Acrobat Reader,
   please contact me.

 - An error is produced if the input image is broken. This commonly happens if
   the input image has an invalid EXIF Orientation value of zero. Even though
   only nine different values from 1 to 9 are permitted, Anroid phones and
   Canon DSLR cameras produce JPEG images with the invalid value of zero.
   Either fix your input images with `exiftool` or similar software before
   passing the JPEG to `img2pdf` or run `img2pdf` with `--rotation=ifvalid`
   (if you run img2pdf from the commandline) or by passing
   `rotation=img2pdf.Rotation.ifvalid` as an argument to `convert()` when using
   img2pdf as a library.

 - img2pdf uses PIL (or Pillow) to obtain image meta data and to convert the
   input if necessary. To prevent decompression bomb denial of service attacks,
   Pillow limits the maximum number of pixels an input image is allowed to
   have. If you are sure that you know what you are doing, then you can disable
   this safeguard by passing the `--pillow-limit-break` option to img2pdf. This
   allows one to process even very large input images.

Installation
------------

On a Debian- and Ubuntu-based systems, img2pdf can be installed from the
official repositories:

	$ apt install img2pdf

If you want to install it using pip, you can run:

	$ pip3 install img2pdf

If you prefer to install from source code use:

	$ cd img2pdf/
	$ pip3 install .

To test the console script without installing the package on your system,
use virtualenv:

	$ cd img2pdf/
	$ virtualenv ve
	$ ve/bin/pip3 install .

You can then test the converter using:

	$ ve/bin/img2pdf -o test.pdf src/tests/test.jpg

If you don't want to setup Python on Windows, then head to the
[releases](https://gitlab.mister-muffin.de/josch/img2pdf/releases) section and download the latest
`img2pdf.exe`.

GUI
---

There exists an experimental GUI with all settings currently disabled. You can
directly convert images to PDF but you cannot set any options via the GUI yet.
If you are interested in adding more features to the PDF, please submit a merge
request. The GUI is based on tkinter and works on Linux, Windows and MacOS.

Library
-------

The package can also be used as a library:

	import img2pdf

	# opening from filename
	with open("name.pdf","wb") as f:
		f.write(img2pdf.convert('test.jpg'))

	# opening from file handle
	with open("name.pdf","wb") as f1, open("test.jpg") as f2:
		f1.write(img2pdf.convert(f2))

	# opening using pathlib
	with open("name.pdf","wb") as f:
		f.write(img2pdf.convert(pathlib.Path('test.jpg')))

	# using in-memory image data
	with open("name.pdf","wb") as f:
		f.write(img2pdf.convert("\x89PNG...")

	# multiple inputs (variant 1)
	with open("name.pdf","wb") as f:
		f.write(img2pdf.convert("test1.jpg", "test2.png"))

	# multiple inputs (variant 2)
	with open("name.pdf","wb") as f:
		f.write(img2pdf.convert(["test1.jpg", "test2.png"]))

	# convert all files ending in .jpg inside a directory
	dirname = "/path/to/images"
	imgs = []
	for fname in os.listdir(dirname):
		if not fname.endswith(".jpg"):
			continue
		path = os.path.join(dirname, fname)
		if os.path.isdir(path):
			continue
		imgs.append(path)
	with open("name.pdf","wb") as f:
		f.write(img2pdf.convert(imgs))

	# convert all files ending in .jpg in a directory and its subdirectories
	dirname = "/path/to/images"
	imgs = []
	for r, _, f in os.walk(dirname):
		for fname in f:
			if not fname.endswith(".jpg"):
				continue
			imgs.append(os.path.join(r, fname))
	with open("name.pdf","wb") as f:
		f.write(img2pdf.convert(imgs))


	# convert all files matching a glob
	import glob
	with open("name.pdf","wb") as f:
		f.write(img2pdf.convert(glob.glob("/path/to/*.jpg")))

	# convert all files matching a glob using pathlib.Path
	from pathlib import Path
	with open("name.pdf","wb") as f:
		f.write(img2pdf.convert(*Path("/path").glob("**/*.jpg")))

	# ignore invalid rotation values in the input images
	with open("name.pdf","wb") as f:
		f.write(img2pdf.convert('test.jpg'), rotation=img2pdf.Rotation.ifvalid)

	# writing to file descriptor
	with open("name.pdf","wb") as f1, open("test.jpg") as f2:
		img2pdf.convert(f2, outputstream=f1)

	# specify paper size (A4)
	a4inpt = (img2pdf.mm_to_pt(210),img2pdf.mm_to_pt(297))
	layout_fun = img2pdf.get_layout_fun(a4inpt)
	with open("name.pdf","wb") as f:
		f.write(img2pdf.convert('test.jpg', layout_fun=layout_fun))

	# use a fixed dpi of 300 instead of reading it from the image
	dpix = dpiy = 300
	layout_fun = img2pdf.get_fixed_dpi_layout_fun((dpix, dpiy))
	with open("name.pdf","wb") as f:
		f.write(img2pdf.convert('test.jpg', layout_fun=layout_fun))

	# create a PDF/A-1b compliant document by passing an ICC profile
	with open("name.pdf","wb") as f:
		f.write(img2pdf.convert('test.jpg', pdfa="/usr/share/color/icc/sRGB.icc"))

Comparison to ImageMagick
-------------------------

Create a large test image:

	$ convert logo: -resize 8000x original.jpg

Convert it into PDF using ImageMagick and img2pdf:

	$ time img2pdf original.jpg -o img2pdf.pdf
	$ time convert original.jpg imagemagick.pdf

Notice how ImageMagick took an order of magnitude longer to do the conversion
than img2pdf. It also used twice the memory.

Now extract the image data from both PDF documents and compare it to the
original:

	$ pdfimages -all img2pdf.pdf tmp
	$ compare -metric AE original.jpg tmp-000.jpg null:
	0
	$ pdfimages -all imagemagick.pdf tmp
	$ compare -metric AE original.jpg tmp-000.jpg null:
	118716

To get lossless output with ImageMagick we can use Zip compression but that
unnecessarily increases the size of the output:

	$ convert original.jpg -compress Zip imagemagick.pdf
	$ pdfimages -all imagemagick.pdf tmp
	$ compare -metric AE original.jpg tmp-000.png null:
	0
	$ stat --format="%s %n" original.jpg img2pdf.pdf imagemagick.pdf
	1535837 original.jpg
	1536683 img2pdf.pdf
	9397809 imagemagick.pdf

Comparison to pdfLaTeX
----------------------

pdfLaTeX performs a lossless conversion from included images to PDF by default.
If the input is a JPEG, then it simply embeds the JPEG into the PDF in the same
way as img2pdf does it. But for other image formats it uses flate compression
of the plain pixel data and thus needlessly increases the output file size:

	$ convert logo: -resize 8000x original.png
	$ cat << END > pdflatex.tex
	\documentclass{article}
	\usepackage{graphicx}
	\begin{document}
	\includegraphics{original.png}
	\end{document}
	END
	$ pdflatex pdflatex.tex
	$ stat --format="%s %n" original.png pdflatex.pdf
	4500182 original.png
	9318120 pdflatex.pdf

Comparison to podofoimg2pdf
---------------------------

Like pdfLaTeX, podofoimg2pdf is able to perform a lossless conversion from JPEG
to PDF by plainly embedding the JPEG data into the pdf container. But just like
pdfLaTeX it uses flate compression for all other file formats, thus sometimes
resulting in larger files than necessary.

	$ convert logo: -resize 8000x original.png
	$ podofoimg2pdf out.pdf original.png
	stat --format="%s %n" original.png out.pdf
	4500181 original.png
	9335629 out.pdf

It also only supports JPEG, PNG and TIF as input and lacks many of the
convenience features of img2pdf like page sizes, borders, rotation and
metadata.

Comparison to Tesseract OCR
---------------------------

Tesseract OCR comes closest to the functionality img2pdf provides. It is able
to convert JPEG and PNG input to PDF without needlessly increasing the filesize
and is at the same time lossless. So if your input is JPEG and PNG images, then
you should safely be able to use Tesseract instead of img2pdf. For other input,
Tesseract might not do a lossless conversion. For example it converts CMYK
input to RGB and removes the alpha channel from images with transparency. For
multipage TIFF or animated GIF, it will only convert the first frame.

Comparison to econvert from ExactImage
--------------------------------------

Like pdflatex and podofoimg2pf, econvert is able to embed JPEG images into PDF
directly without re-encoding but when given other file formats, it stores them
just using flate compressen, which unnecessarily increases the filesize.
Furthermore, it throws an error with CMYK TIF input. It also doesn't store CMYK
jpeg files as CMYK but converts them to RGB, so it's not lossless. When trying
to feed it 16bit files, it errors out with Unhandled bps/spp combination. It
also seems to choose JPEG encoding when using it on some file types (like
palette images) making it again not lossless for that input as well.
