the Odoo online store when using a payment method with the option
enabled.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module adds the option “Confirm Order Automatically” to the
website's payment providers. It is intended only for payment methods
that require manual confirmation, such as bank transfer or equivalent
custom methods (e.g., money orders or cash on delivery managed outside
of Odoo).

When this option is enabled, the sales order is automatically confirmed
after checkout is completed, without waiting for payment reconciliation.

It should not be enabled for online payment gateways (Stripe, Redsys,
PayPal, etc.), as these automatically confirm the order when the
transaction is authorized. Enabling it in these cases could result in
duplicate or premature confirmations.

Usage
=====

1. Go to **Payment Methods** in the admin panel.
2. Enable the *Confirm Order Automatically* option for the desired
   payment method.
3. When a customer completes a sale using that payment method, the order
   will be automatically confirmed after payment validation.
