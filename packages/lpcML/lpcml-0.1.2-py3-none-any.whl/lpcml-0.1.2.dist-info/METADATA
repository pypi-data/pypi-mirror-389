# LPC ML

LPC ML is a tool developed in the CiTIUS, USC by the MODEV group for training a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network to optimize and analyze the impact of different design parameters on laser power converters (LPCs) solar cells.

Data used to feed the neural networks is shared in [data/hLPC_GaAS_5W_ml.csv](data/hLPC_GaAS_5W_ml.csv).

## Installation
First you need to have installed **pip3** on your system. For Ubuntu, open up a terminal and type:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-pip

**Installation of lpcML via pip3**

Install the tool using pip3:

    pip3 install lpcML

and check the library is installed by importing it from a **python3 terminal**:

    import lpcML

Unless an error comes up, LPC ML is now installed on your environment.

> ⚠️ **WARNING** 
> If the module is already installed, make sure to upgrade it to the latest version before using it. 

    pip3 install lpcML --upgrade

> ❗ **CAUTION**  
> To ensure the versions compatibility and avoiding the *urllib3 (2.2.1) or chardet (4.0.0) doesn't match a supported version!* error use the following command:

    pip3 install --upgrade requests



## First Steps

To store the simulation data from optimizations or an iterative simulation process into a json file, you can use the [simulations_to_json.ipynb](simulations_to_json.ipynb) file.

An step by step example to train an MLP neural network model with the simplest output (one FoM) is reported in the jupyter notebook: [lpc_ml_calibration.ipynb](lpc_ml_calibration.ipynb).

You can find another example of a dynamic-ouptut (multiple FoMs) MLP neural network in [lpc_ml_calibration_multiplefoms.ipynb](lpc_ml_calibration_multiplefoms.ipynb)

The I-V curves can also be predicted by training an MLP model as shown in [lpc_ml_calibration_iv.ipynb](lpc_ml_calibration_.ipynb)
