# libdc3

Library designed to implement all operations needed for DC3 application and at the same time be human-usable through python scripts or notebooks.

## Installation

To install libdc3, simply

```bash
$ pip install libdc3
```

## Environment variables

This library depends heavily on `runregistry` python package, so it is needed to set `SSO_CLIENT_ID` and `SSO_CLIENT_SECRET` in your environment.

The interface with `brilcalc` is done via SSH or standard python subprocess if `brilconda` environment is available under the `/cvmfs` location. If executing in an environment without `brilconda`, you need to configure the `dc3_config` object with your LXPlus credentials (recommended via environment variables).

Last but not least, in order to successfully communicate with `DQMGUI` and `T0` endpoints a valid CERN Grid certificate is needed. Again, the `dc3_config` object should be configured with paths to the grid certificated and key (that should be opened).

## SWAN setup

1. Configure your SWAN environment using `Software stack 105a` and select the option `Use Python packages installed on CERNBox`
2. Create a SWAN project with any name you like and upload all example notebooks to it
3. Open SWAN terminal and create a `.env` file under your project directory and add the following variables: `SSO_CLIENT_ID`, `SSO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AUTH_CERT`, `AUTH_CERT_KEY`
4. On any notebook, create a new cell and add `pip install libdc3`.

## Development

Install the dependencies and the package using `uv`:

```shell
uv sync --all-groups
uv run pre-commit install
uv pip install -e .
```

### Running tests

Run tests with `pytest`:

```shell
uv run pytest tests
```

#### Tox

Tox is pre-configured in `tox.ini`, so you can run the following to test against multiple python versions locally:

```bash
uv run tox
```

**[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) users**

tox requires multiple versions of Python to be installed. Using `asdf`, you have multiple versions installed, but they aren’t normally exposed to the current shell. You can use the following command to expose multiple versions of Python in the current directory:

```bash
asdf set python 3.12.9 3.11.10 3.10.13 3.9.19
```

This will use `3.12.9` by default (if you just run `python`), but it will also put `python3.11`, `python3.10` and `python3.9` symlinks in your path so you can run those too (which is exactly what tox is looking for).

### Releasing the package on PyPI

The package is available in PyPI at [libdc3](https://pypi.org/project/libdc3/), under the [cmsdqm](https://pypi.org/org/cms-dqm/) organization. You'll need at leat Mantainer rights to be able to push new versions.

#### CI

Do not worry. The GitLab CI is configured to automatically publish the package on PyPI and the release notes in GitLab whever a tag is pushed to the repo.

> [!NOTE]
> For this to work the CI/CD variables named `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_TOKEN` should be registered in gitlab. The `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN` is a api token access of CMSDQM organization and the `GITLAB_TOKEN` is a Project Access Token with api read/write rights, which is needed to read merge requests using the `glab-cli`.

#### Manual

If you want to follow the manual approach, you need to first build and then publish.

##### Build

You can use uv to build the package using:

```bash
uv build
```

The build system will automatically update the package version based on the git tag of the current commit.

##### Publish

Provided you have already generate a PyPI api token in your account or in CMDQM org, you can publish using:

```bash
UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN=... uv publish
```
