# bibliographer

`bibliographer` is a Python program to compile a list of books you've read.

It's designed to pull your reading library from Audible and Kindle,
enrich those libraries with metadata like ISBN, book covers, and Wikipedia links,
and save the results to individual JSON files for use by other programs.
For instance, it retrieves the data for the
[`/books` section of my website](https://me.micahrl.com/books).

Right now, there are some mild assumptions that the consumer is a Hugo static site,
but it can be used generically too,
and work is ongoing to improve this.

## Features

> [!CAUTION]
> Retrieving your Audible library via this program relies on the
> [audible](https://github.com/mkb79/Audible) Python package
> and may violate Amazon's terms of service.
> It also saves your Audible credentials in plain text to your filesystem,
> by default in a file called `./.bibliographer-audible-auth-INSECURE.json`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Retrieving ASINs (Amazon product IDs) via this program scrapes `https://amazon.com`
> which may violate Amazon's terms of service.

> [!NOTE]
> Retrieving your Kindle library requires logging in to <https://read.amazon.com>
> and running some JavaScript in the web console,
> which cannot be done for you automatically and is a bit user-unfriendly
> but probably(?) doesn't violate Amazon's terms of service.

- Library ingestion
  - Automatically pull your library from Audible,
    which requires your username, password, and 2 factor OTP
  - Automatically pull your library from Libro.fm,
    which requires your username and password
  - Parse your library from Kindle,
    which requires you to generate it by logging in to <https://read.amazon.com>
    and running some code in the web dev tools
  - Add books one by one
- Retrieve metadata on books
  - Pull cover images from Google Books
  - Look up ISBN from title/authors
  - Find Wikipedia pages for title/authors
  - Find Amazon product pages from ISBN or title/author
- Cache API results;
  once a result is retrieved, its cached in a JSON file designed to be retained
  (committed to git, etc)
- Allow manual changes
  - Metadata retrieval isn't perfect;
    you can edit JSON files to change the mapping of books in your library
    to metadata from external APIs,
    and this will be retained on subsequent runs of the program
- Save metadata to a JSON file for use by other programs like static site generators etc

## Installing

I recommend [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for this,
but it should work with regular pip as well.

```sh
# With uv
uvx bibliographer --help

# With pip
pip install bibliographer
bibliographer --help
```

### Installing for development

In theory there's nothing uv-specific about the code,
but only uv is tested.
Clone the repo, and then:

```sh
uv add --dev .[dev]
. .venv/bin/activate
```

`bibliographer` supports the `--debug`/`-D` flag
which will drop you into the debugger on any unhandled exception.

```sh
bibliographer -D ...
```

## `bibliograhper` versioning

We follow [Pride Versioning](https://pridever.org/).

You can't expect [real stability](https://semver.org/)
because the most important APIs we use are ~~user-hostile~~undocumented,
so we might as well have fun.

## Usage examples

### Simple usage with Audible

Without any other configuration, this will:

* Prompt you to log in to your Audible account
* Retrieve your Audible library
* Retrieve metadata from various APIs like OpenLibrary
* Save your Audible library to `bibliographer/data/apicache/audible_library_metadata.json`
* Populate some mapping files in `bibliographer/data/usermaps`:
  * `audible_library_metadata_enriched.json`: to save enriched data about your books
  * `isbn2olid_map.json`: to map your books to OpenLibrary IDs
  * `search2asin.json`: to find an ASIN on Amazon.com for your books
  * `wikipedia_relevant.json`: to contain a list of relevant Wikipedia pages
* Create a slug directory inside `bibliographer/books` for each book based on its title,
  like `bibliographer/books/getting-things-done`.
  The slug can be configured inside `audible_library_metadata_enriched.json`.
* Create a `cover.jpg` (or `.png` etc) inside each slug directory
* Create a `bibliographer.json` file containing enriched metadata inside each slug directory

```sh
# Retrieve library from Audible
bibliographer audible

# Populate bibliographer.json metadata files
bibliograhper populate
```

### Simple usage with libro.fm

```sh
# Retrieve library from Libro.fm
bibliographer --librofm-username you@example.com --librofm-password p@ssw0rd librofm retrieve

# Populate bibliographer.json metadata files
bibliographer populate
```

### Simple usage with Kindle

`bibliographer` doesn't currently support retrieving the Kindle library automatically.
Instead, you must log in to your Kindle account in a web browser,
run some JavaScript in the browser's developer tools,
copy the output,
and provide it to `bibliographer` yourself.

1.  Log into <https://read.amazon.com> in a web browser where you have access to the developer tools.
    This has been tested most extensively in Firefox.
2.  Open the JavaScript console in Developer Tools.
    In FireFox on macOS, this means
    Tools -> Browser Tools -> Web Developer Tools,
    then select the Console tab.
3.  Copy and paste the contents of [`exportKindleLibrary.js`](./docs/exportKindleLibrary.js).
    Run it by pressing <kbd>`Return`</kbd>
4.  That will download a file called `kindle-library.json`.

Now ingest the data and populate the `bibliographer.json` metadata files with:

```sh
bibliographer kindle ingest /path/to/kindle-library.json
bibliographer populate
```

### Logging

Passing the `--verbose`/`-v` flag provides detailed log messages.
If you're ingesting more than a handful of books at a time,
it's nice to do this to know that the process hasn't gotten stuck.

```sh
bibliographer -v ...
```

### Changing settings in usermaps

The usermaps directory is populated based on some heuristic queries,
but you may want to override these.
After enriching book metadata,
you should always check that these heuristics found the correct data for your books.

For instance, the book
[Blackletter: Type and National Identity](https://me.micahrl.com/books/blackletter-type-and-national-identity)
is by design historian [Paul Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Shaw_%28design_historian%29),
but Wikipedia knows [several people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Shaw)
by that name and may have returned the disambiguation page or one of the other individuals.
To fix that, you can edit the `bibliographer/data/apicache/wikipedia_relevant.json` file
to point to the correct Paul Shaw.

```json
{
  // ...
  "title=Blackletter: Type and National Identity;authors=Peter Bain|Paul Shaw": {
    "Paul Shaw": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Shaw_(design_historian)"
  },
  // ...
}
```

### Using with Hugo

When using with Hugo,
it's useful to set a config file in the Hugo repository root.

```text
hugosite/
  assets/
    bibliographer/
      apicache/
        audible_library_metadata.json
        ...
      usermaps/
        audible_library_metadata_enriched.json
        ...
  content/
    books/
      getting-things-done/
        index.md
        bibliographer.json
        cover.jpg
      ...
  bibliographer.toml
  hugo.toml
```

You might set the `bibliographer.toml` config file like:

```toml
google_books_key = "your-google-books-key"
bibliographer_data = "assets/bibliographer"
book_slug_root = "content/books"
individual_bibliographer_json = true
```

And run the program like:

```sh
# Inside the hugosite directory, bibliographer will find the bibliographer.toml automatically
cd hugosite/
# Now run it as normal
bibliographer audible
bibliograhper populate
```

It'll create book slug directories inside of `content/books`,
ready to be picked up by your Hugo site.

### Example Hugo templates

If you have a Hugo site as described above,
with `content/books/` as your `book_slug_root`,
you can make a Hugo layout file in e.g. `layouts/books/single.html`
that will generate book pages.
Here's a simple example:

Your Hugo templates can get the JSON data and cover files like this:

```go-html-template
{{- define "main" }}

<section class="book-metadata">

  {{ $coverImg := (index (where (.Resources.Match "cover.*") "ResourceType" "in" (slice "image" "image/jpg" "image/jpeg" "image/png" "image/gif" "image/webp")) 0) }}
  <img src="{{ $coverImg.RelPermalink }}">

  {{ $book := .Resources.Get "bibliographer.json" | transform.Unmarshal }}
  <dl class="public-book-metadata">
    <dt>Author</dt>
    <dd>{{ delimit $book.authors ", " }}</dd5>

    {{ with $book.isbn }}
    <dt>ISBN</dt>
    <dd>{{ . }}</dd>
    {{ end }}

    <dt>Book Data</dt>
    <dd>
      <ul>
        {{ with $book.openlibrary_id }}<li><a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/{{ . }}">Open Library</a></li>{{ end }}
        {{ with $book.gbooks_volid }}<li><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id={{ . }}">Google Books</a></li>{{ end }}
      </ul>
    </dd>

    {{- if and $book.urls_wikipedia (gt (len $book.urls_wikipedia) 0) }}
    <dt>Elsewhere</dt>
    <dd>
      <ul>
        {{ range $title, $url := $book.urls_wikipedia }}
        <li><a href="{{ $url }}">{{ $title }} - Wikipedia</a></li>
        {{- end }}
      </ul>
    </dd>
    {{ end }}
  </dl>

</section>

<section>
  {{ .Content }}
</section>

{{- end }}
```

### Example output `bibliographer.json` file

Running `bibliographer populate` will create a file called `bibliographer.json` for each book in your library.
That file looks like this:

```json
{
  "title": "Getting Things Done",
  "authors": [
    "David Allen"
  ],
  "isbn": "9780143126560",
  "purchase_date": null,
  "read_date": "2024-11-01",
  "published": null,
  "links": {
    "metadata": {
      "openlibrary": "https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26211544M"
    },
    "affiliate": {
      "amazon": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0143126563"
    },
    "other": [
      {
        "title": "Getting Things Done - Wikipedia",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done"
      },
      {
        "title": "David Allen - Wikipedia",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### The `bibliographer.toml` config file

Some command-line arguments can be set in a configuration file so you don't need to pass them at runtime.
`bibliographer` looks for a file called `bibliographer.toml` or `.bibliographer.toml`
in the runtime `$PWD` and all of its parents,
or you can pass it explicitly with `--config`.

The options in the config file correspond to command-line options,
and are shown below in the program help output.

File paths specified in the config file can be absolute,
or relative _to the directory containing the config file_.

<!--[[[cog
import cog
from bibliographer.cli.bibliographer import get_example_config
cog.out(f"```toml\n{get_example_config()}```\n")
]]]-->
```toml
debug = false
verbose = false
google_books_key = ""
google_books_key_cmd = ""
librofm_username = ""
librofm_password = ""
librofm_password_cmd = ""
individual_bibliographer_json = false
book_slug_root = "bibliographer/books"
audible_login_file = ".bibliographer-audible-auth-INSECURE.json"
bibliographer_data = "bibliographer/data"
```
<!--[[[end]]]-->

### API cache files

Results from external APIs are stored in `{bibliographer_data}/apicache/*.json` files.
These files are not inteded to be edited by hand.
Currently these files include:

* `audible_library_metadata.json`
* `kindle_library_metadata.json`
* `gbooks_volumes.json`

### User mapping files

Mapping of IDs and search queries from various sources to specific API results
are stored in `{bibliographer_data}/usermaps/*.json` files.
These **are** intended to be edited by hand.
Currently these files include:

* `asin2gbv_map.json`:
  Mapping ASINs (Amazon product IDs used by Kindle and Audible) to Google Books volume IDs
* `isbn2olid_map.json`:
  Mapping ISBNs to OpenLibrary IDs
* `search2asin.json`:
  Mapping a search term, which might be an ISBN or a title + author, to ASIN
* `wikipedia_relevant.json`:
  Mapping a search time, like a title or an author, to a Wikipedia page
* `audible_library_metadata_enriched.json`:
  "Enriched" data for the Audible library, including the Audible ASIN as a key,
  and an object with ISBN, links, etc as a value.
* `kindle_library_metadata_enriched.json`:
  "Enriched" data for the Kindle library,
  including the Kindle ASIN as a key,
  and an object with ISBN, links, etc as a value.
* `manual.json`:
  A manual library with books added directly on the command line from
  `bibliographer manual add ...`

### Generating and saving a Google Books API Key

See the [Google Books API documentation](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using)
for information on obtaining and using an API key.

You can pass it in or save it directly with `--google-books-key`,
and you can also use the `google_books_key_cmd` config file option (or command line argument)
to provide a command to retrieve the key from a password manager.
For instance, if you have a 1Password entry called `GoogleBooksApi`
that has a field called `bibliographer-google-books-api-key`,
you might set this in `bibliographer.toml`:

```toml
google_books_key_cmd = "op item get GoogleBooksApi --field label=bibliographer-google-books-api-key"
```

This way you can safely store your config file in git without committing any secrets in plain text.

You can also set the key directly in `bibliographer.toml` if you prefer:

```toml
google_books_key = "your key goes here"
```

## Future

* Goodreads support mrled/bibliographer#11
* Support other site generators besides Hugo generically mrled/bibliographer#4
