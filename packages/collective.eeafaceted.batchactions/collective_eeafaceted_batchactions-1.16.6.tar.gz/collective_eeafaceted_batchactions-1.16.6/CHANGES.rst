  - Introduce idea of section for the viewlet and the batch actions so it is
    possible to display different actions on different viewlets or different

  `update` methods have been called.

  just reload the current faceted results.

  which action was applied on how much elements.
  [gbastien]

1.5 (2020-04-23)

  [gbastien]
- Refactored the way form is updated and applied : two methods are there to be
  overrided : `_update` that is called in the `update` process and `_apply` that
  is called by `handleApply`.  This way it is easy to build an new action
  without having to think about basic default behavior.
  [gbastien]

  a particular CSS class is added to the button so it can be skinned
  with an icon easily.
