# ========================================
# "Now." Feature (Optional)
# ========================================
# The "Now." feature lets you share quick updates about what you're currently doing,
# thinking, or working on. It's like a micro-blog that appears on your homepage.
#
# To enable this feature:
# 1. Uncomment the lines below
# 2. Run "bw scaffold" to create the example now.html template
# 3. Add the Now. markers to your index.html where you want the latest update to appear
# 4. Use "bw new_now" to create a new update
# 5. Use "bw generate_now" to publish your updates
#
# Each Now. post is a simple markdown file named by date (e.g., 2025-10-28.md)
# The latest update appears on your homepage, and all updates are archived on now.html
#
# Configuration options:
# - now_folder: Folder where your Now. markdown files are stored
# - now_template: HTML page listing all your Now. posts (e.g., example.com/now.html)
# - now_index_template: HTML template snippet for displaying the latest Now. post in index.html
#                       This template lets you customize how the Now. section appears on your homepage
#
# now_folder = "now"
# now_template = "now.html"
