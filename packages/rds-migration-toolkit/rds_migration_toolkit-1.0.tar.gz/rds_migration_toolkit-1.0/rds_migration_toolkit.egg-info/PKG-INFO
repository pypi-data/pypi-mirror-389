              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# RDS Migration Library

A production-grade Python library for migrating AWS RDS PostgreSQL databases with comprehensive support for materialized views, connection management, validation, and DataDog monitoring.

## Features

- **Database Migration**: Dump and restore PostgreSQL databases using `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`
- **Materialized Views**: Automatic detection, dependency resolution, and concurrent refresh
- **Connection Management**: Pre-flight testing, active connection termination, role password rotation
- **Validation**: Comprehensive pre/post-migration validation with statistics comparison
- **Statistics Collection**: Database and table-level metrics (row counts, sizes, indexes, functions, sequences, triggers)
- **DataDog Integration**: All operations send metrics and traces to DataDog
- **Type-Safe**: Full type hints throughout the codebase
- **OOP Design**: Modular classes that can be used independently or composed

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Or using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Migrate all databases in staging
rds-migrate migrate --environment staging

# Migrate specific database
rds-migrate migrate -e staging --database mydb

# Dry run (see what would be done)
rds-migrate migrate -e staging --dry-run

# Pre-migration validation
rds-migrate validate -e staging

# Get database statistics
rds-migrate stats -e staging -d mydb --tables

# List materialized views
rds-migrate list-views -e staging -d mydb

# Refresh materialized views
rds-migrate refresh-views -e staging -d mydb
```

### Library Usage

```python
from rds_migration import (
    MigrationConfig,
    DatabaseMigrator,
    ConnectionManager,
    DatabaseValidator,
    Database,
    RDSConfig,
)

# Initialize configuration
config = MigrationConfig.for_environment("staging")

# Full migration with all features
migrator = DatabaseMigrator(config)
results = migrator.migrate_all()

# Or use individual components
from rds_migration.datadog import DataDogMonitor

# Connection management only
monitor = DataDogMonitor(enabled=True, environment="staging")
rds_config = RDSConfig(
    rds_id="db-XXX",
    endpoint="mydb.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
    password="secret",
)
db = Database(rds_config, monitor)
conn_manager = ConnectionManager(db, monitor)

# Test connection
if conn_manager.test_connection():
    print("Connection successful!")

# Get connection statistics
stats = conn_manager.get_connection_stats("mydb")
print(f"Active: {stats['active']}, Idle: {stats['idle']}")

# Terminate connections for a role
terminated = conn_manager.terminate_connections("mydb", role_name="app_user")
print(f"Terminated {terminated} connections")

# Validation only
validator = DatabaseValidator(db, monitor)
db_stats = validator.get_database_stats("mydb")
validator.print_stats_table(db_stats)

# Compare source and destination
source_stats = validator.get_database_stats("mydb")
dest_stats = validator.get_database_stats("mydb")
is_valid, messages = validator.validate_migration("mydb", source_stats, dest_stats)
```

# Get source database statistics with table details
rds-migrate stats -e staging -d mydb --source --tables
```

### `list-views`

List all materialized views in a database with their properties.

**Options:**
- `--environment, -e`: Target environment
- `--database, -d`: Database name (required)

```

## Library Architecture

### Core Components

#### `DatabaseMigrator`
Main orchestrator that coordinates the entire migration process.

```python
from rds_migration import MigrationConfig, DatabaseMigrator

config = MigrationConfig.for_environment("staging")
migrator = DatabaseMigrator(config, enable_datadog=True)

# Test connections before migration
if migrator.test_connections():
    # Validate databases
    results = migrator.validate_databases()

    # Perform migration
    results = migrator.migrate_all()
```

#### `ConnectionManager`
Manages database connections, termination, and role password rotation.

```python
from rds_migration import ConnectionManager, Database, RDSConfig

db = Database(RDSConfig(...))
conn_manager = ConnectionManager(db)

# Test connection
conn_manager.test_connection()

# Get active connections
connections = conn_manager.get_active_connections("mydb", role_name="app_user")

# Terminate connections
count = conn_manager.terminate_connections("mydb", role_name="app_user", wait_seconds=10)

# Rotate password and terminate
success, count = conn_manager.terminate_and_rotate("mydb", "app_user")

# Get connection statistics
stats = conn_manager.get_connection_stats("mydb")
```

#### `DatabaseValidator`
Collects statistics and validates migrations.

```python
from rds_migration import DatabaseValidator, Database

validator = DatabaseValidator(Database(...))

# Get database statistics
stats = validator.get_database_stats("mydb")
print(f"Tables: {stats.table_count}, Rows: {stats.total_row_count}")

# Get table-level statistics
table_stats = validator.get_table_stats("mydb")
for ts in table_stats:
    print(f"{ts.table_name}: {ts.row_count} rows")

# Validate migration
is_valid, messages = validator.validate_migration("mydb", source_stats, dest_stats)

# Print formatted tables
validator.print_stats_table(stats)
validator.print_comparison_table("mydb", source_stats, dest_stats)
```

#### `MaterializedViewManager`
Manages materialized view detection, dependency resolution, and refresh.

```python
from rds_migration import MaterializedViewManager, Database

view_manager = MaterializedViewManager(Database(...))

# List views
views = view_manager.list_materialized_views("mydb")

# Check if refresh is needed
if view_manager.should_refresh_views("mydb"):
    # Refresh all views with dependency resolution
    results = view_manager.refresh_all_views("mydb", concurrent=False)

    # Refresh specific view
    success, rows, duration = view_manager.refresh_materialized_view("mydb", "my_view")
```

### Configuration

Configuration is managed through the `MigrationConfig` class with environment-specific presets.

```python
from rds_migration.config import MigrationConfig, Environment

# Use environment preset
config = MigrationConfig.for_environment(Environment.STAGING)

# Or create custom configuration

## DataDog Monitoring

All operations send metrics and traces to DataDog under the service name `databaseMigrationLibrary`.

### Metrics

**Database Operations:**
- `database.connection.duration.seconds` - Connection establishment time
- `database.query.duration.seconds` - Query execution time
- `database.command.duration.seconds` - Command execution time
- `database.dump.duration.seconds` - pg_dump duration
- `database.dump.size.bytes` - Dump file size
- `database.restore.duration.seconds` - pg_restore duration
- `database.vacuum.duration.seconds` - VACUUM ANALYZE duration

**Connection Management:**
- `connections.active` - Active connections
- `connections.idle` - Idle connections
- `connections.idle_in_transaction` - Idle in transaction
- `connections.total` - Total connections
- `connections.terminated` - Terminated connections

**Validation:**
- `validation.completed` - Validation runs (tagged with status)
- `validation.errors` - Number of validation errors
- `validation.warnings` - Number of validation warnings
- `database.table_count` - Number of tables
- `database.view_count` - Number of views
- `database.total_row_count` - Total row count
- `database.size_bytes` - Database size

**Migration:**
- `migration.started` - Migration initiated
- `migration.completed` - Successful migration
- `migration.failed` - Failed migration
- `migration.duration.seconds` - Total migration time

**Materialized Views:**
- `materialized_views.total` - Total views in database
- `materialized_views.refresh.started` - Refresh initiated
- `materialized_views.refresh.completed` - Successful refresh
- `materialized_views.refresh.failed` - Failed refresh
- `materialized_views.refresh.duration.seconds` - Refresh duration
- `materialized_views.refresh.rows` - Rows in refreshed view

### Traces

Distributed traces are created for:
- `database.connect` - Database connections
- `database.query` - Query execution
- `database.command` - Command execution
- `database.dump` - pg_dump operations
- `database.restore` - pg_restore operations
- `database.vacuum_analyze` - VACUUM ANALYZE
- `connections.terminate` - Connection termination
- `materialized_views.refresh` - View refresh

### Tags

All metrics and traces include relevant tags:
- `environment`: Environment name (staging, production)
- `database`: Database name
- `source`: Source environment/RDS
- `destination`: Destination environment/RDS
- `status`: Operation status (success, failure, error)
- `role`: Role name (for connection operations)
- `view`: View name (for materialized view operations)

## Environment Variables

```bash
# AWS Configuration
AWS_PROFILE=staging
AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# DataDog Configuration (optional)
DD_AGENT_HOST=localhost
DD_AGENT_PORT=8125
```

## Configuration Files

### Excluded Databases

By default, the following databases are excluded from migration:
- `postgres` (system database)
- `rdsadmin` (AWS RDS management)
- `template0` (PostgreSQL template)
- `template1` (PostgreSQL template)

### SSM Parameter Store

Passwords are retrieved from AWS SSM Parameter Store using the pattern:
```
/${environment}/applications/wms/rds/BU_SHARED_PG_PASSWORD
```

For example:
- Staging: `/staging/applications/wms/rds/BU_SHARED_PG_PASSWORD`
- Production: `/production/applications/wms/rds/BU_SHARED_PG_PASSWORD`

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=rds_migration

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_migration.py
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Type checking
mypy rds_migration/

# Linting
ruff check rds_migration/

# Formatting
black rds_migration/
```

## Comparison to Bash Script

This Python library matches and exceeds the capabilities of the original bash script:

| Feature | Bash Script | Python Library |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Database Migration | ✅ | ✅ |
| Materialized Views | ✅ | ✅ (with dependency resolution) |
| Connection Management | ✅ | ✅ |
| Validation Mode | ✅ | ✅ |
| Statistics Collection | ✅ | ✅ (enhanced) |
| Role Management | ✅ | ✅ |
| DataDog Monitoring | ❌ | ✅ |
| Type Safety | ❌ | ✅ |
| Modular Design | ❌ | ✅ |
| Library Usage | ❌ | ✅ |
| CLI Commands | Basic | Rich with multiple commands |
| Error Handling | Basic | Comprehensive |
| Logging | Echo statements | Structured logging |
| Testing | Manual | Automated tests |

### Key Advantages

1. **Modularity**: Individual components can be used independently
2. **Type Safety**: Full type hints for better IDE support and fewer bugs
3. **DataDog Integration**: Comprehensive metrics and tracing
4. **Better Error Handling**: Structured exceptions with detailed context
5. **Rich Output**: Beautiful terminal tables using Rich library
6. **Dry Run Support**: See what would happen without executing
7. **Flexible Configuration**: Environment-specific presets with override support
8. **Library + CLI**: Can be used as both a library and command-line tool

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

```bash
# Test connections before migration
rds-migrate validate -e staging

# Check connection statistics
rds-migrate stats -e staging -d mydb
```

### Materialized View Dependencies

If materialized view refresh fails due to dependencies:

```bash
# List all views to see dependencies
rds-migrate list-views -e staging -d mydb

# Refresh views one at a time
rds-migrate refresh-views -e staging -d mydb -v view1
```

### Validation Failures

```bash
# Compare source and destination statistics
rds-migrate stats -e staging -d mydb --source
rds-migrate stats -e staging -d mydb

# Run validation to see detailed differences
rds-migrate validate -e staging -d mydb
```
