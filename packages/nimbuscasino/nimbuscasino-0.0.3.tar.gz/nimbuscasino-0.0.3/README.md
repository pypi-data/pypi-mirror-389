**nimbuscasino** is a lightweight Python package offering a collection of fun, chance-based mini-games such as Rock-Paper-Scissors, Coin Flip, Roulette, and Slots. It’s designed for developers who want to add playful interactions or short mental breaks into their applications, while keeping the logic deterministic, testable, and credit-agnostic. Each function is pure (no I/O or global state), returns structured outcomes and payouts, and can be easily integrated into simulations, chatbots, or playful apps.

⚠️ *This package is for entertainment and educational use only — no real gambling or monetary transactions are involved.*
