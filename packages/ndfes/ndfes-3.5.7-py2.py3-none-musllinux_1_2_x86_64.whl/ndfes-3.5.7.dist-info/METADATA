INSTALLATION
------------

The configuration is performed with ``cmake``. You will need ``cmake``
(version 3.12 or later installed). The installation of the python
components is performed with ``pip``.

To install ``cmake`` and update your version of ``pip``, you can run::

   USERBASE=$(python3 -m site --user-base)
   USERSITE=$(python3 -m site --user-site)
   export PATH="${USERBASE}/bin:${PATH}"
   export PYTHONPATH="${USERSITE}:${PYTHONPATH}"
   python3 -m pip install pip --upgrade --user
   python3 -m pip install cmake --upgrade --user

You should consider adding the above export commands to your
``${HOME}/.bashrc`` and then ``source ~/.bashrc``.

If, for whatever reason, ``pip`` is unavailable on your system, you
can install it using the directions here:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

To install ndfes::

   cd build
   bash ./run_cmake.sh
   make install VERBOSE=1 -j4
   cd ../local
   export PATH="${PWD}/bin:${PATH}"
   export PYTHONPATH="${PWD}/lib/python3.XX/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}"

where ``python3.XX`` should be replaced by the appropriate python version.

ndfes has dependencies on ``blas/lapack`` and ``nlopt``.
The ``cmake`` configuration will check if these libraries are available.
If they are not available, it will automatically download them from
github and install them.

The ``blas/lapack`` libraries are installed from the openblas package.
   https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS
The ``nlopt`` software is used to perform nonlinear optimizations.
   https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt

These libraries could also be installed globally using your system's
package manager. For example, on Fedora, you could install them with::

   sudo dnf install NLopt-devel openblas

See the contents of ``build/run_cmake.sh`` to see how you can adjust
the compilers, compiler flags, python interpreter, and installation
directory.
