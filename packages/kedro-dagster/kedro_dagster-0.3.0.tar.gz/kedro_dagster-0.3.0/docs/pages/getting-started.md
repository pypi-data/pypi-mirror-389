# Getting Started

This guide walks you through setting up and deploying a Kedro project with Dagster using the Kedro‑Dagster plugin. The example below uses the Kedro `spaceflights-pandas` starter project, but you can use your own Kedro project. If you wish to do so, skip step 1.

## 1. Create a Kedro project (optional)

*Skip this step if you already have a Kedro project you want to deploy with Dagster.*

If you don't already have a Kedro project, you can create one using a starter template:

```bash
kedro new --starter=spaceflights-pandas
```

Follow the prompts to set up your project. Once it is done, install the dependencies of your project:

```bash
cd spaceflights-pandas
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Installation

Install the plugin with `pip`:

```bash
pip install kedro-dagster
```

or with `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install kedro-dagster
```

alternatively, you can install it from GitHub:

```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/gtauzin/kedro-dagster.git
```

## 3. Initialize the Dagster integration

Use [`kedro dagster init`](api.md#kedro-dagster-init) to initialize Kedro‑Dagster:

```bash
kedro dagster init --env local
```

This creates:

- `src/definitions.py`: Dagster entrypoint file that exposes all translated Kedro objects as Dagster objects.

``` title="definitions.py"
--8<-- "src/kedro_dagster/templates/definitions.py"
```

- `conf/local/dagster.yml`: Dagster configuration file for the `local` Kedro environment.

``` title="dagster.yml"
--8<-- "src/kedro_dagster/templates/dagster.yml"
```

There's no need to modify the Dagster `definitions.py` file to get started, so here we'll have a deeper look on the `dagster.yml` file.

## 4. Configure jobs, executors, and schedules

The Kedro‑Dagster configuration file `dagster.yml` includes the following sections:

- **schedules:** Used to set up cron schedules for jobs.
- **executors:** Used to specify the compute targets for jobs (in-process, multiprocess, k8s, etc).
- **jobs:** Used to describe jobs through the filtering of Kedro pipelines.

Let's edit the automatically generated `conf/local/dagster.yml` to customize jobs, executors, and schedules:

```yaml
schedules:
  daily: # Schedule name
    cron_schedule: "0 0 * * *" # Schedule parameters

executors: # Executor name
  sequential: # Executor parameters
    in_process:

  multiprocess:
    multiprocess:
      max_concurrent: 2

jobs:
  default: # Job name
    pipeline: # Pipeline filter parameters
      pipeline_name: __default__
    executor: sequential

  parallel_data_processing:
    pipeline:
      pipeline_name: data_processing
      node_names:
      - preprocess_companies_node
      - preprocess_shuttles_node
    schedule: daily
    executor: multiprocess

  data_science:
    pipeline:
      pipeline_name: data_science
    schedule: daily
    executor: sequential
```

Here, we have added a "parallel_data_processing" and a "data_science" job to the jobs configuration. The first one makes use of the `node_names` Kedro pipeline filter argument to create a sub-pipeline of the Kedro "data_processing" pipeline from a list of two Kedro nodes: "preprocess_companies_node" and "preprocess_shuttles_node". Both jobs are to run daily using the "daily" schedule based on the `cron_schedule` "0 0 * * *". "parallel_data_processing" is to run using a "multiprocess" executor with 2 `max_concurrent` and "data_science" will run sequentially.

See the [Technical documentation](technical.md) for more on customizing the Dagster configuration file.

## 5. Browse the Dagster UI

Use [`kedro dagster dev`](api.md#kedro-dagster-dev) to start the Dagster development server:

```bash
kedro dagster dev --env local
```

!!! note

    The `dagster.yml` file also include a **dev** section, containing the default parameters of the command. Check out the [API Reference](api.md#kedro-dagster-dev) for more info.

The Dagster UI will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) by default.

You can inspect assets, jobs, and resources, trigger or automate jobs, and monitor runs from the UI.

### Assets

Moving to the "Assets" tab leads to the list of assets generated from the Kedro datasets that are involved in the filtered pipelines specified in `dagster.yml`.

<figure markdown>
![List of assets involved in the specified jobs](../images/getting-started/asset_list_dark.png#only-dark){data-gallery="assets-dark"}
![List of assets involved in the specified jobs](../images/getting-started/asset_list_light.png#only-light){data-gallery="assets-light"}
<figcaption>Asset List.</figcaption>
</figure>

Each asset is prefixed by the Kedro environment that was passed to the [`KedroProjectTranslator`](api.md#kedroprojecttranslator) in [`definitions.py`](technical.md#definitionspy). If the Kedro dataset was generated from a [dataset factory](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/data/kedro_dataset_factories.html), the namespace that prefixed its name will also appear as a prefix, allowing easy browsing of assets per environment and per namespace.

Clicking on the "Asset lineage" link at the top right of the window leads to the Dagster asset lineage graph, where you can observe the dependencies between assets and check their status and description.

<figure markdown>
![Lineage graph of assets involved in the specified jobs](../images/getting-started/asset_graph_dark.png#only-dark){data-gallery="assets-dark"}
![Lineage graph of assets involved in the specified jobs](../images/getting-started/asset_graph_light.png#only-light){data-gallery="assets-light"}
<figcaption>Asset Lineage Graph.</figcaption>
</figure>

!!! note
    Assets can be materialized directly from the "Assets" tab. Clicking on "materialize" will trigger an asset job. Note that asset jobs are not based on Kedro pipelines and therefore do not preserve any Kedro hooks.

### Resources

Kedro‑Dagster defines one Dagster IO Manager per Kedro Dataset to interface with their `save` and `load` method. As with assets, they are defined per Kedro environment and their name is prefixed with the environment followed by a double underscore separator.

<figure markdown>
![List of the resources involved in the specified jobs](../images/getting-started/resource_list_dark.png#only-dark){data-gallery="resources-dark"}
![List of the resources involved in the specified jobs](../images/getting-started/resource_list_light.png#only-light){data-gallery="resources-light"}
<figcaption>Resource list.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Automation

Moving to the "Automation" tab, you can see a list of the defined schedules and sensors. Kedro-Dagster preserve Kedro hooks and uses a sensor to enable the `on_pipeline_error` hook.

<figure markdown>
![List of the schedules and sensors involved in the specified jobs](../images/getting-started/automation_list_dark.png#only-dark){data-gallery="automation-dark"}
![List of the schedules and sensors involved in the specified jobs](../images/getting-started/automation_list_light.png#only-light){data-gallery="automation-light"}
<figcaption>Schedule and Sensor List.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Jobs

To see the different jobs defined in `dagster.yml`, click on the "Jobs" tab. You'll see the list of the defined jobs with names prefixed by the Kedro environment followed by a double underscore.

<figure markdown>
![List of the specified jobs](../images/getting-started/job_list_dark.png#only-dark){data-gallery="jobs-dark"}
![List of the specified jobs](../images/getting-started/job_list_light.png#only-light){data-gallery="jobs-light"}
<figcaption>Job List.</figcaption>
</figure>

Clicking on the "parallel_data_processing" job brings you to a graph representation of the corresponding Dagster-translated Kedro pipeline. `before_pipeline_run` and `after_pipeline_run` are included as the first and final nodes of the job graph. As for the schedule, each of them has its name prefixed with the name of the job it is applied and a double underscore to so that they can be applied independently.

<figure markdown>
![Graph describing the "parallel_data_processing" job](../images/getting-started/job_graph_dark.png#only-dark){data-gallery="jobs-dark"}
![Graph describing the "parallel_data_processing" job](../images/getting-started/job_graph_light.png#only-light){data-gallery="jobs-light"}
<figcaption>Job Graph.</figcaption>
</figure>

The job can be run by clicking on the "Launchpad" sub-tab. The Kedro pipeline, its parameters (mapped to Dagster Config), and the Kedro datasets (mapped to IO managers) can be modified before launching a run.

<figure markdown>
![Launchpad for the "parallel_data_processing" job](../images/getting-started/job_launchpad_dark.png#only-dark){data-gallery="jobs-dark"}
![Launchpad for the "parallel_data_processing" job](../images/getting-started/job_launchpad_light.png#only-light){data-gallery="jobs-light"}
