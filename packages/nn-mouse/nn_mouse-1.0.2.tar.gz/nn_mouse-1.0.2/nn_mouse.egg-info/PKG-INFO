# nn-mouse

Neural network based humanized mouse movements. The models in this projects are from https://github.com/DaiCapra/Natural-Mouse-Movements-Neural-Networks

## Demo

![Demo](output.gif)

## Installation

You can install the package via pip:

```
pip install nn-mouse[opencv] mouse

or 

pip install nn-mouse[opencv-contrib] mouse

```

Note: Any mouse module that can parse the current location of the mouse and move the mouse can be used. In this example, https://github.com/boppreh/mouse is used.

## Usage

```python
import time

import mouse

from nn_mouse import get_path

# monitor size
w, h = 1920, 1080

# current location
x, y = mouse.get_position()

# destination location
x1, y1 = 435, 578

# get the path of the movement
path = get_path(x, y, x1, y1, w, h)

#     ...
# ]

# move the mouse based on the path
for x, y, t in path:
    mouse.move(x, y)
    time.sleep(t)

```
