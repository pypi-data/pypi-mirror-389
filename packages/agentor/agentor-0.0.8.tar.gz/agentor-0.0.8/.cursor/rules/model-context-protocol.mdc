# model-context-protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation provides the foundation for agent communication and resource management:

## Core Components

1. API Router (src/agentor/mcp/api_router.py)
- Implements JSON-RPC style method routing between agents
- Manages tool registration and discovery
- Handles resource allocation and access control
Importance Score: 80/100

2. Tool Registry (src/agentor/tools/registry.py)
- Centralized tool registration system
- Tool metadata management and validation
- Access control for registered capabilities
Importance Score: 70/100

3. Agent Communication Patterns
- Hierarchical routing through Main Triage Agent
- Specialized agent interfaces for:
  * Concept Research
  * Code Operations
  * Google Services Integration
- Structured message passing protocol
Importance Score: 85/100

## Resource Management

1. Tool Registration Flow
- Tools register capabilities and requirements
- Metadata validation ensures complete tool definitions
- Access permissions assigned during registration
Importance Score: 75/100

2. Inter-Agent Communication
- JSON-RPC message format for standardized interactions
- Context preservation between agent handoffs
- Resource scope management per agent
Importance Score: 80/100

The protocol enables complex task delegation while maintaining security boundaries and resource access controls between different agent roles and their assigned tools.
