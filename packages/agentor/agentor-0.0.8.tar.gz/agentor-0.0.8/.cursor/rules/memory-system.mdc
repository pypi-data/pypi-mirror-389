# memory-system

The memory management system (src/agentor/memory/api.py) implements a specialized conversation memory architecture with three core components:

1. Vector Database Storage Layer
- Persists conversation history using semantic vector embeddings
- Maintains conversation context across multiple interactions
- Provides context-aware storage segmentation
Importance Score: 85/100

2. Semantic Embedding Engine
- Utilizes sentence transformers for converting conversation text to embeddings
- Handles semantic similarity calculations for context retrieval
- Maintains embedding consistency across conversation sessions
Importance Score: 80/100

3. Context Retrieval System
- Implements conversation context search capabilities
- Provides relevancy-based memory access for agents
- Manages context window limitations and memory pruning
Importance Score: 75/100

Key Business Workflows:
1. Conversation Memory Flow
- New conversation inputs are embedded and stored
- Relevant historical context is retrieved for each interaction
- Context windows are managed based on relevancy scores

2. Context Search Operations
- Semantic similarity matching for finding relevant past interactions
- Prioritized retrieval based on temporal and relevancy factors
- Contextual boundary management for multi-topic conversations

The memory system serves as a critical component for maintaining coherent long-term interactions and enabling context-aware agent responses across the platform.
