# agent-orchestration

The agent orchestration system implements a hierarchical structure with specialized roles and delegated responsibilities:

## Agent Hierarchy
- Main Triage Agent (src/agentor/agenthub/main.py)
  - Acts as central coordinator
  - Routes incoming requests to specialized agents
  - Manages task delegation and agent communication
  - Importance Score: 85/100

## Specialized Agents
1. Concept Research Agent
   - Handles topic research tasks
   - Integrates with web search capabilities
   - Importance Score: 75/100

2. Coder Agent 
   - Manages code-related queries
   - Web search integration for technical documentation
   - Importance Score: 80/100

3. Google Agent
   - Gmail and Calendar operations
   - Privacy-aware data handling
   - Consent management for user data
   - Importance Score: 90/100

## Communication Patterns
- JSON-RPC style method handling
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for agent interactions
- Tool/resource registration for inter-agent capabilities
- Importance Score: 80/100

## Task Delegation
- Centralized routing through Main Triage Agent
- Specialized capability matching
- Privacy-aware request handling
- Vector-based memory system for context preservation
- Importance Score: 85/100

The orchestration system's core value lies in its hierarchical delegation model and specialized agent roles that enable complex task handling while maintaining privacy and context awareness.
