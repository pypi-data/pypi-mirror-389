        """
        Searches for relevant functions based on queries and/or applications. This function
        operates in three powerful modes with support for multi-query searches:

        1.  **Global Search** (`queries` only as List[List[str]]):
            - Searches all functions across all applications.
            - Supports multiple independent searches in parallel.
            - Each inner list represents a separate search query.

            Examples:
            - Single global search:
              `search_functions(queries=[["create presentation"]])`

            - Multiple independent global searches:
              `search_functions(queries=[["send email"], ["schedule meeting"]])`

            - Multi-term search for comprehensive results:
              `search_functions(queries=[["send email", "draft email", "compose email"]])`

        2.  **App Discovery** (`app_ids` only as List[str]):
            - Returns ALL available functions for one or more specific applications.
            - Use this to explore the complete capability set of an application.

            Examples:
            - Single app discovery:
              `search_functions(app_ids=["Gmail"])`

            - Multiple app discovery:
              `search_functions(app_ids=["Gmail", "Google Calendar", "Slack"])`

        3.  **Scoped Search** (`queries` as List[List[str]] and `app_ids` as List[str]):
            - Performs targeted searches within specific applications in parallel.
            - The number of app_ids must match the number of inner query lists.
            - Each query list is searched within its corresponding app_id.
            - Supports multiple search terms per app for comprehensive discovery.

            Examples:
            - Basic scoped search (one query per app):
              `search_functions(queries=[["find email"], ["share file"]], app_ids=["Gmail", "Google_Drive"])`

            - Multi-term scoped search (multiple queries per app):
              `search_functions(
                  queries=[
                      ["send email", "draft email", "compose email", "reply to email"],
                      ["create event", "schedule meeting", "find free time"],
                      ["upload file", "share file", "create folder", "search files"]
                  ],
                  app_ids=["Gmail", "Google Calendar", "Google_Drive"]
              )`

            - Mixed complexity (some apps with single query, others with multiple):
              `search_functions(
                  queries=[
                      ["list messages"],
                      ["create event", "delete event", "update event"]
                  ],
                  app_ids=["Gmail", "Google Calendar"]
              )`

        **Pro Tips:**
        - Use multiple search terms in a single query list to cast a wider net and discover related functionality
        - Multi-term searches are more efficient than separate calls
        - Scoped searches return more focused results than global searches
        - The function returns connection status for each app (connected vs NOT connected)
        - All searches within a single call execute in parallel for maximum efficiency

        **Parameters:**
        - `queries` (List[List[str]], optional): A list of query lists. Each inner list contains one or more
          search terms that will be used together to find relevant tools.
        - `app_ids` (List[str], optional): A list of application IDs to search within or discover.

        **Returns:**
        - A structured response containing:
          - Matched tools with their descriptions
          - Connection status for each app
          - Recommendations for which tools to load next
