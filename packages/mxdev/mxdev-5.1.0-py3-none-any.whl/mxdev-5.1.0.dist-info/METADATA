# Mixed development source packages on top of stable constraints using pip

*mxdev* [mɪks dɛv] is a utility that makes it easy to work with Python projects containing lots of packages, of which you only want to develop some.

It builds on top of the idea to have stable version constraints and then develop from a VCS on top of it.

As part of the above use-case sometimes versions of the stable constraints need an override with a different (i.e. newer) version.
Other software follow the same idea are [mr.developer](https://pypi.org/project/mr.developer)  for Python's *zc.buildout* or [mrs-developer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mrs-developer) for NPM packages.

**[Star us on Github](https://github.com/mxstack/mxdev)**


## Overview

mxdev procedure is:

1. Configuration is read,
2. Requirements and constraints (given in the configuration) are read.
3. Sources from VCS are fetched into a target directory,
4. Modified constraints (handled packages commented, overridden versions replaced) and requirements (handled packages as editable from sources) are written.

mxdev will **not** run *pip* for you!

## Installation

```bash
pip install mxdev
```

**mxdev >=4.0 needs pip version 23 at minimum to work properly**

## Quick Start

1. **Create `mx.ini`** configuration file:

```ini
[settings]
requirements-in = requirements.txt
requirements-out = requirements-mxdev.txt
constraints-out = constraints-mxdev.txt

# Custom variables for reuse
github = git+ssh://git@github.com/

[mypackage]
url = ${settings:github}myorg/mypackage.git
branch = main
extras = test
```

2. **Run mxdev** to fetch sources and generate files:

```bash
mxdev
```

3. **Install with pip** using the generated files:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-mxdev.txt
```

For more examples see the [example/](https://github.com/mxstack/mxdev/tree/main/example) directory.

## Configuration

Configuration is done in an INI file (default: `mx.ini`) using [configparser.ExtendedInterpolation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#configparser.ExtendedInterpolation) syntax.

### Settings Section `[settings]`

The **main section** must be called `[settings]`, even if kept empty.

#### I/O Settings

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `requirements-in` | Input requirements file (can be URL). Empty value = generate from INI only | `requirements.txt` |
| `requirements-out` | Output requirements with development sources as `-e` entries | `requirements-mxdev.txt` |
| `constraints-out` | Output constraints (developed packages commented out) | `constraints-mxdev.txt` |

#### Behavior Settings

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `default-target` | Target directory for VCS checkouts | `./sources` |
| `threads` | Number of parallel threads for fetching sources | `4` |
| `smart-threading` | Process HTTPS packages serially to avoid overlapping credential prompts (see below) | `True` |
| `offline` | Skip all VCS and HTTP fetches; use cached HTTP content from `.mxdev_cache/` (see below) | `False` |
| `default-install-mode` | Default `install-mode` for packages: `editable`, `fixed`, or `skip` (see below) | `editable` |
| `default-update` | Default update behavior: `yes` or `no` | `yes` |
| `default-use` | Default use behavior (when false, sources not checked out) | `True` |

##### Smart Threading

When `smart-threading` is enabled (default), mxdev uses a two-phase approach to prevent credential prompts from overlapping:

1. **Phase 1**: HTTPS packages **without `pushurl`** are processed serially (one at a time) to ensure clean, visible credential prompts
2. **Phase 2**: Remaining packages (SSH, local, HTTPS with `pushurl`) are processed in parallel for speed

**Optimization**: HTTPS URLs with `pushurl` defined are assumed to be read-only/public and processed in parallel, since the `pushurl` indicates authenticated write access is separate.

This solves the problem where parallel git operations would cause multiple credential prompts to overlap, making it confusing which package needs credentials.

**When to disable**: Set `smart-threading = false` if you have git credential helpers configured (e.g., credential cache, credential store) and never see prompts.

##### Offline Mode and HTTP Caching

When `offline` mode is enabled (or via `-o/--offline` flag), mxdev operates without any network access:

1. **HTTP Caching**: HTTP-referenced requirements/constraints files are automatically cached in `.mxdev_cache/` during online mode
2. **Offline Usage**: In offline mode, mxdev reads from the cache instead of fetching from the network
3. **Cache Miss**: If a referenced HTTP file is not in the cache, mxdev will error and prompt you to run in online mode first

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# First run in online mode to populate cache
mxdev

# Subsequent runs can be offline (e.g., on airplane, restricted network)
mxdev -o

# Cache persists across runs, enabling true offline development
```

**Cache location**: `.mxdev_cache/` (automatically added to `.gitignore`)

**When to use offline mode**:
- Working without internet access (airplanes, restricted networks)
- Testing configuration changes without re-fetching
- Faster iterations when VCS sources are already checked out

**Note**: Offline mode tolerates missing source directories (logs warnings), while non-offline mode treats missing sources as fatal errors.

#### Package Overrides

##### `version-overrides`

Override package versions which are already defined in a dependent constraints file.
I.e. an upstream *constraints.txt* contains already `somefancypackage==2.0.3`.
Given that, for some reason (like with my further developed sources), we need version 3.0.0 of the above package.

Then in this section, this can be defined as:

```INI
[settings]
version-overrides =
    somefancypackage==3.0.0
    otherpackage==33.12.1
```

It is possible to add as many overrides as needed.
When writing the *constraints-out*, the new version will be taken into account.
If there is a source section defined for the same package, the source will be used and entries here are ignored.

Note: When using [uv](https://pypi.org/project/uv/) pip install the version overrides here are not needed, since it [supports overrides natively](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#dependency-overrides).
With uv it is recommended to create an `overrides.txt` file with the version overrides and use `uv pip install --override overrides.txt [..]` to install the packages.


##### `ignores`

Ignore packages that are already defined in a dependent constraints file.
No new version will be provided.
This is specifically handy if a package is going to be installed editable from local file system (like `-e .`), but was already pinned in an upstream constraints file.

This can be defined as:

```INI
[settings]
ignores =
    somefancypackage
    otherpackage
```

##### `main-package`

mxdev can handle one Python package as main package directly via ini config.
If defined, it will be added as last entry in the resulting requirements out file.

This can be defined as:

```INI
[settings]
main-package = -e .[test]
```

If the main package is defined in a dependent constraint file, its name must be added to `ignores`.

#### Advanced Settings

##### `include`

Include one or more other INI files.

The included file is read before the main file, so the main file overrides included settings.
Included files may include other files.
Innermost inclusions are read first.

If an included file is an HTTP-URL, it is loaded from there.

If the included file is a relative path, it is loaded relative to the parent's directory or URL.

Default: empty

##### `directory`

mxdev provides a default setting containing the current working directory which can be used inside package or custom sections:

```INI
[sectionname]
param = ${settings:directory}/some/path
```

##### Custom Variables

Additionally, custom variables can be defined as `key = value` pair.
Those can be referenced in other values as `${settings:key}` and will be expanded there.

```INI
[settings]
github = git+ssh://git@github.com/
gitlab = git+ssh://git@gitlab.com/
```

### Package Source Sections

Sections other than `[settings]` can define:
- **Package sources**: `[PACKAGENAME]` - VCS sources to checkout and develop
- **Hook configuration**: `[hookname-section]` - Settings for mxdev extensions (see [EXTENDING.md](https://github.com/mxstack/mxdev/blob/main/EXTENDING.md))

For package sources, the section name is the package name: `[PACKAGENAME]`

#### Basic Package Options

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `url` | **required** | VCS checkout URL | — |
| `vcs` | optional | Version control system: `git`, `fs`, `svn`, `gitsvn`, `hg`, `bzr`, `darcs` | `git` |
| `branch` | optional | Branch name or tag to checkout | `main` |
| `extras` | optional | Comma-separated package extras (e.g., `test,dev`) | empty |
| `subdirectory` | optional | Path to Python package when not in repository root | empty |
| `target` | optional | Custom target directory (overrides `default-target`) | `default-target` |
| `pushurl` | optional | Writable URL(s) for pushes. Supports single URL or multiline list for pushing to multiple remotes. Not applied after initial checkout. | — |

**VCS Support Status:**
- `git` (stable, tested)
- `fs` (stable, tested) - local directory pseudo-VCS
- `svn`, `gitsvn`, `hg`, `bzr`, `darcs` (unstable, tests need rewrite)

#### Installation Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `install-mode` | `editable`: Install with `-e` (development mode)<br>`fixed`: Install without `-e` (production/Docker)<br>`skip`: Only clone, don't install<br>⚠️ `direct` is deprecated, use `editable` | `default-install-mode` |
| `use` | When `false`, source is not checked out and version not overridden | `default-use` |

#### Git-Specific Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `depth` | Git clone depth (shallow clone). Set `GIT_CLONE_DEPTH=1` env var for global default | full clone |
| `submodules` | Submodule handling: `always`, `checkout`, `recursive` (see below) | `always` |

##### Git Submodule Modes

- **`always`** (default): Git submodules will always be checked out, updated if already present
- **`checkout`**: Submodules only fetched during checkout, existing submodules stay untouched
- **`recursive`**: Fetches submodules recursively, results in `git clone --recurse-submodules` on checkout and `submodule update --init --recursive` on update

##### Multiple Push URLs

You can configure a package to push to multiple remotes (e.g., mirroring to GitHub and GitLab):

```ini
[my-package]
url = https://github.com/org/repo.git
pushurl =
    git@github.com:org/repo.git
    git@gitlab.com:org/repo.git
    git@bitbucket.org:org/repo.git
```

When you run `git push` in the checked-out repository, Git will push to all configured pushurls sequentially.

**Note:** Multiple pushurls only work with the `git` VCS type. This mirrors Git's native behavior where a remote can have multiple push URLs.

### Usage

Run `mxdev` (for more options run `mxdev --help`).

Mxdev will

1. **read** the configuration from `mx.ini`,
2. **fetch** the packages defined in the config file and
3. **write** a requirements and constraints file.

Now, use the generated requirements and constraints files with i.e. `pip install -r requirements-mxdev.txt`.

## Example Configuration

### Example `mx.ini`

This looks like so:

```INI
[settings]
requirements-in = requirements.txt
requirements-out = requirements-mxdev.txt
constraints-out = constraints-mxdev.txt

version-overrides =
    baz.baaz==1.9.32

ignores =
    my.ignoredpackage

# custom variables
github = git+ssh://git@github.com/
mygit = git+ssh://git@git.kup.tirol/

[foo.bar]
url = ${settings:github}orga/foo.bar.git
branch = fix99
extras = test,baz

[kup.fancyproject]
url = ${settings:mygit}customers/fancycorp/kup.fancyproject.git
branch = fix99
extras = test,baz
```

## Extending

The functionality of mxdev can be extended by hooks.
This is useful to generate additional scripts or files or automate any other setup steps related to mxdev's domain.

See [EXTENDING.md](https://github.com/mxstack/mxdev/blob/main/EXTENDING.md) for complete documentation on creating mxdev extensions.

## Rationale

### Problem

There is a constraint file like `-c constraints.txt` with a package `foo.bar` with a version pin.
Then it is not possible to install this package in a requirements file editable like `-r requirements.txt` with `-e git+ssh://git@github.com/orga/foo.bar.git@fix-99`.
Neither it is possible to override inherited version constraints with custom ones.

### Idea
A pre-processor fetches (as this can be an URL) and expands all `-c SOMEOTHER_FILE_OR_URL` and `-r SOMEOTHER_FILE_OR_URL` files into one, filtering out all packages given in a configuration file.
For each of those packages, a `-e ...` entry is generated instead and written to a new `TARGET.txt`.
Same is true for version overrides: a new entry is written to the resulting constraints file while the original version is disabled.
The configuration is read from a file `mx.ini` in *ExtendedInterpolation* INI syntax (YAML would be nice, but the package must have as less dependencies as possible to other packages).

### Trivia
Mx (generally pronounced like mix [mɪks], or [məks] in the UK) is meant to be a gender-neutral alternative to the titles Mr. and Ms. but also associates with the word "mix".

## Changes

## 5.1.0

- Feature: Git repositories can now specify multiple push URLs using multiline syntax in the `pushurl` configuration option. This enables pushing to multiple remotes (e.g., GitHub + GitLab mirrors) automatically. Syntax follows the same multiline pattern as `version-overrides` and `ignores`. Example: `pushurl =` followed by indented URLs on separate lines. When `git push` is run in the checked-out repository, it will push to all configured pushurls sequentially, mirroring Git's native multi-pushurl behavior. Backward compatible with single pushurl strings.
  [jensens, 2025-11-03]
- Feature: Added `--version` command-line option to display the current mxdev version. The version is automatically derived from git tags via hatch-vcs during build. Example: `mxdev --version` outputs "mxdev 5.1.0" for releases or "mxdev 5.1.1.dev27+g62877d7" for development versions.
  [jensens, 2025-11-03]

## 5.0.2 (2025-10-23)

- Fix #70: HTTP-referenced requirements/constraints files are now properly cached and respected in offline mode. Previously, offline mode only skipped VCS operations but still fetched HTTP URLs. Now mxdev caches all HTTP content in `.mxdev_cache/` during online mode and reuses it during offline mode, enabling true offline operation. This fixes the inconsistent behavior where `-o/--offline` didn't prevent all network activity.
  [jensens]
- Improvement: Enhanced help text for `-n/--no-fetch`, `-f/--fetch-only`, and `-o/--offline` command-line options to better explain their differences and when to use each one.
  [jensens]

## 5.0.1 (2025-10-23)

- Fix #65: Check source directories exist before writing to requirements-mxdev.txt. In **offline mode**: missing sources log WARNING and are written as comments (expected behavior). In **non-offline mode**: missing sources log ERROR and mxdev exits with RuntimeError (fatal error indicating checkout failure). This fixes mxmake two-stage installation workflow and prevents silent failures when sources fail to check out.
  [jensens]
- Fix: Configuration parsing no longer logs "Can not parse override:" errors when `version-overrides` is empty. Empty lines in `version-overrides` and `ignores` are now properly skipped during parsing. Also fixed bug where `ignores` lines were not properly stripped of whitespace.
  [jensens]
- Fix: Three tests that were accidentally marked as skipped during PR #66 merge are now fixed and passing: `test_resolve_dependencies_simple_file` (fixed assertion to check line contents), `test_write_output_with_ignores` (fixed to use read() for proper ignore processing), and `test_write_relative_constraints_path_different_dirs` (fixed to include constraints content).
  [jensens]
- Chore: Improved test coverage for main.py from 42% to 100%. Added comprehensive tests for the main() function covering all CLI argument combinations (--verbose, --silent, --offline, --threads, --no-fetch, --fetch-only), ensuring robust testing of the entry point and all code paths.
  [jensens]
- Chore: Updated test fixture data versions to resolve Dependabot security alerts. Updated urllib3 from 1.26.9 to 2.5.0 and requests from 2.28.0 to 2.32.4 in test data files. These are test fixtures only and were never actual dependencies or security risks. Resolves GitHub Dependabot alerts #1-7.
  [jensens]
- Performance: Smart threading now processes HTTPS URLs with `pushurl` in parallel. When a package defines both an HTTPS `url` and a `pushurl` (typically SSH), the HTTPS URL is assumed to be read-only/public and won't prompt for credentials, making it safe for parallel processing. This improves checkout performance for the common pattern of public repos with separate push URLs.
  [jensens]
- Fix: Add 'synchronize' event to pull_request workflow triggers. This ensures CI runs when PRs are updated with new commits (e.g., after rebasing or pushing new changes), not just when opened or reopened.
  [jensens]
- Chore: Optimize GitHub Actions to prevent duplicate workflow runs on pull requests. Restrict `push` trigger to only run on `main` branch, so PRs only trigger via `pull_request` event. This reduces CI resource usage by 50% for PR workflows.
  [jensens]
- Fix: `process_line()` now correctly comments out packages in `override_keys` and `ignore_keys` for both requirements and constraints files. Previously, these settings only applied to constraints files (variety="c"). Now they work for requirements files (variety="r") as well, with the message "-> mxdev disabled (version override)" for override_keys in requirements.
  [jensens]

## 5.0.0 (2025-10-22)

- **Breaking**: Drop support for Python 3.8 and 3.9. Minimum required version is now Python 3.10.
  [jensens]
- **Breaking**: Modernize type hints to use Python 3.10+ syntax (PEP 604: `X | Y` instead of `Union[X, Y]`)
- Use built-in generic types (`list`, `dict`, `tuple`) instead of `typing.List`, `typing.Dict`, `typing.Tuple`
  [jensens]
- Chore: Replace black with ruff for faster linting and formatting. Configure ruff with line-length=120 and appropriate rule selections. Keep isort for import sorting with plone profile and force-alphabetical-sort. This modernizes the tooling stack for better Python 3.10+ support and faster CI runs.
  [jensens]
- Feature: #54: Add `fixed` install mode for non-editable installations to support production and Docker deployments. The new `editable` mode replaces `direct` as the default (same behavior, clearer naming). The `direct` mode is now deprecated but still works with a warning. Install modes: `editable` (with `-e`, for development), `fixed` (without `-e`, for production/Docker), `skip` (clone only).
  [jensens]
- Fix #35: Add `smart-threading` configuration option to prevent overlapping credential prompts when using HTTPS URLs. When enabled (default), HTTPS packages are processed serially first to ensure clean credential prompts, then other packages are processed in parallel for speed. Can be disabled with `smart-threading = false` if you have credential helpers configured.
  [jensens]
- Fix #34: The `offline` configuration setting and `--offline` CLI flag are now properly respected to prevent VCS fetch/update operations. Previously, setting `offline = true` in mx.ini or using the `--offline` CLI flag was ignored, and VCS operations still occurred.
  [jensens]
- Fix #46: Git tags in branch option are now correctly detected and handled during updates. Previously, updating from one tag to another failed because tags were incorrectly treated as branches.
  [jensens]
- Fix #22 and #25: Constraints file path in requirements-out is now correctly calculated as a relative path from the requirements file's directory. This allows requirements and constraints files to be in different directories. Previously, the path was written from the config file's perspective, causing pip to fail when looking for the constraints file. On Windows, paths are now normalized to use forward slashes for pip compatibility.
  [jensens]
- Fix #53: Per-package target setting now correctly overrides default-target when constructing checkout paths.
  [jensens]
- Fix #55: UnicodeEncodeError on Windows when logging emoji. The emoji is now conditionally displayed only when the console encoding supports it (UTF-8), avoiding errors on Windows cp1252 encoding.
  [jensens]

## 4.1.1 (2025-10-20)

- Modernize release method with hatchling. See RELEASE.md [jensens]
- Modernize tox setup. [jensens]
- Modernize Github workflows. [jensens]
- Enhance test coverage [jensens]
- Fix Makefile. [jensens]


## 4.1.0 (2025-06-03)

- Support environment variable `GIT_CLONE_DEPTH` for setting a default git depth for all checkouts.  Useful for CI.
  [maurits]

- Fix #47: Do not add packages with capital names uncommented at the bottom ignore list when checked out.
  [petschki]

## 4.0.3 (2024-05-17)

- Fix #45: Packages with capital names do not get ignored when checked out.
  [jensens]


## 4.0.2 (2024-03-13)

- Fix #42: deprecated use of `pkg_resoures` to load entry points and parse requirements.
  This enables mxdev to work on Python 3.12, where `pkg_resources` is no longer installed by default in virtual_envs.
  [jensens]

## 4.0.1 (2024-03-01)

- Fix specifying out a revision (#40)
  [pbauer]

### 4.0.0 (2024-02-28)

- Breaking: Remove `--pre` on sources from generated `requirements-mxdev.txt`.
  Usually it is not needed any longer, at least withy pip 23.x.
  This is a breaking change if you rely on the `--pre` option being present in the generated file.
  Now the `--pre` option should be added to `pip install` when the generated file is used.
  This change enables the use of the generated file with the alternative pip replacement `uv`.
  [jensens]

- Breaking: Drop official support for Python 3.7 (it is end of life).
  [jensens]

- Document `mx.ini` sections `vcs` setting.
  [jensens]

### 3.1.0 (2023-12-10)

- Feature: Provide `directory` default setting [rnix]
- Feature: Include other INI config files [jensens]

### 3.0.0 (2023-05-08)

- Removed leftover print [jensens]

### 3.0.0b3 (2023-04-23)

- Fix usage of `--install-option='pre'` and use `--pre` option in requirements files instead.
  The install options are deprecated in pip 23 which Plone switched to recently.
  More info:
  https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11358
  https://discuss.python.org/t/passing-command-line-arguments-to-pip-install-after-install-options-deprecation/22981/6
  [thet, fredvd]

- Fix reading sections from the config parser without defaults if the section contains a setting that also exists as default.
  [rnix]

- Do not write constraints out to the file if no constraints are defined.
  [rnix]

- Add the `main-package` option to the settings.
  [rnix]

### 3.0.0b2 (2023-02-07)

- In this package, use `pyproject.toml` and markdown for README et al.
  [jensens]

- Add `use` option to sources, and `default-use` to the settings.
  `default-use` is true by default.
  When false, the source is not checked out, and the version for this package is not overridden.
  [maurits]


### 3.0.0b1 (2022-11-21)

- Do not use `libvcs`, but recycled and updated (type hints, tests) `mr.developer` VCS code.
  Code for GIT is tested well, code for SVN, Mercurial, Bazaar and DARCS needs contributors with knowledge in this area.
  Additional options, like `pushurl`, ... (see README) were added.
  `pip` style VCS URLs are not supported any longer.
  [jensens, rnix, zworkb]

- Config parser options are now considered case-sensitive.
  [rnix]

- Do not fail `mxdev` run if `requirements.txt` is missing.
  [rnix]

- Add flag to only fetch repositories and skip generating files.
  [rnix]

- Add flag to skip fetching of repositories.
  [rnix]

- Add support for custom hooks.
  [rnix]

- Rename `sources.ini` to `mx.ini` in the documentation.
  [rnix]

- Introduce state object and pass it to read/fetch/write.
  State object contains all required runtime data.
  [rnix]


### 2.0.0 (2022-01-31)

- Depend on pip 22, where interdependency mode is no longer needed.
  Remove all interdependency-related code.
  [jensens]

- Better error message if the requirements-in file does not exist.
  [jensens]

- Better last message with the full pip command.
  [jensens]

- Allow empty `requirements-in` configuration.
  [jensens]

### 1.1.0 (2021-12-29)

- Feature: Ignore existing constraints.
  New setting `ignores` with a list of packages (one per line) to ignore constraints without providing a version.
  [jensens]


### 1.0.1 (2021-12-21)

- Fix: If a developed package depends on another developed package the dependent package was ignored *sometimes* (!?).
  Instead, the last release was taken.
  Solution: Install it with the `--pre` option in order to allow the other non-final/in-development *release*.
  [jensens]


### 1.0.0 (2021-12-12)

- Defaults for "outfiles" are `*-mxdev.txt` now.
  [jensens]
