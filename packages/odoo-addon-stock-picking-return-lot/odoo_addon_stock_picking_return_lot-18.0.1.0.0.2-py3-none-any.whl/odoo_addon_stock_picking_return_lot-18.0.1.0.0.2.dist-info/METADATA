When a product is tracked by lot or serial number and is returned by a
customer, it’s crucial to clearly indicate to the user which lot or
serial number can be accepted. This way, we prevent user from receiving
a product with a lot or serial number different from the original
delivery.

This module enhances the return process by creating a separate return
line for each product/lot and automatically pre-filling it with the lot
from the original delivery. It relies on the `Stock Restrict
Lot <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/tree/18.0/stock_restrict_lot>`__
module to enforce accurate tracking, ensuring that the reception order
reflects the correct lot or serial number that should be received.

This module also integrates with [Stock Picking Return Restricted Qty]
(https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/tree/18.0/stock_picking_return_restricted_qty)
because the quantities are now split up per lot.

Usage
=====

To use this module, go to a done receipt or delivery in the inventory,
and click the Return button. Odoo will show all products with the
originally transferred quantity per lot (minus any quantities that were
transferred earlier).

If you click the 'Return All' button here, this module will ensure that
the originally transferred lots and serials are applied automatically to
the resulting return transfer.

You can also choose to return only part of the original transfer and
update the quantities here, before clicking the 'Return' button. If the
picking type of the original transfer was marked to restrict returned
quantities, you will not be allowed to enter a higher quantity than is
available to return.
