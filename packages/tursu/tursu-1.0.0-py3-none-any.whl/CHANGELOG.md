## 0.16.0 - Released on 2025-04-16

* Add asyncio support.
  Using the `@asyncio` tag in Gherkin scenario, generated tests will be coroutine.
  And steps definition can be coroutine too.
  This is the same decorators ([@given](#tursu.given), [@when](#tursu.when),
  [@then](#tursu.then)) for the step definition to register sync and async
  step definitions function.

## 0.15.2 - Released on 2025-04-10

* Update Gherkin to fix third person grammar in doc and tests.

## 0.15.1 - Released on 2025-04-05

  It will not raise an error anymore but they will never be interpreted.

## 0.15.0 - Released on 2025-04-04

* Breaking change: Step definitions are not globals anymore,
  they are scoped like pytest fixtures. they lives in a module and all its sub modules.
  A submodules steps can be used to define the definition of the current scenario directory.
  See the [project layout documentation](#project-layout) for the details.
* pytest fixtures can be created in the same modules than step definitions.
  Sometimes fixtures does not need to be shared accross submodules, they are locals of a
  part of a test, like having a [@when](#tursu.when) that save a value like downloading a file in the browser,
  and a [@then](#tursu.then) that check its content.
