## Installation
```bash
pip install trainlytics
```

## Quickstart
```python
from trainlytics import ingest, clean, features, model, recommender
# See notebooks/ for complete examples
```

## Project Structure
- `src/trainlytics/`: Core package modules
- `notebooks/`: EDA, modeling, reporting
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
- `docs/`: Documentation, changelog, references
- `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD
- `data/`: Sample data
