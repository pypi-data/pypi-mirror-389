## 1. Reasoning

`pre-commit` is a nice little tool that helps you polish your code before releasing it into the wild.
It is fairly easy to use. A single `pre-commit-config.yaml` file can hold multiple hooks (checks) that will go through
your code or repository and do certain checks. The problem is that the file is static and once you pin your hook versions
after a while they get outdated.

`pre-commit-update` was created because there is no easy way to update your hooks by using
`pre-commit autoupdate` as it is not versatile enough.

                                                REPO_URL_TRIM (still checks for the new
                                                versions) - use '*' as a wildcard

  -b, --bleeding-edge REPO_URL_TRIM             Get the latest version or commit of specific
                                                repo(s) by the REPO_URL_TRIM - use '*' as a

  -h, --help                                    Show this message and exit.
```

Below you can find more detailed explanations of how each option works.

Some of the options (`--exclude`, `--keep` and `--bleeding-edge`) use `REPO_URL_TRIM` as an argument.

Example of the `REPO_URL_TRIM`: `https://github.com/ambv/black` -> `black` (you will only pass `black` as a parameter to the
`--exclude`, `--keep` or `--bleeding-edge` option)


- `-c, --config-file FILE` - Path to the configuration pyproject.toml file. This can be an absolute or relative path. Make
sure that the path ends with `pyproject.toml`.


- `-d, --dry-run / -nd, --no-dry-run` - If enabled, updates will be fetched, but they won't be applied. Useful if you are only
curious about potential changes that would occur.


- `-dm, --dry-run-mode [strict|warn]` - If set to `strict`, the changes will be printed and the process will exit. If set to
`warn`, the changes will be printed but the process will not exit. This option is ignored if the `--dry-run` option is not
enabled!


- `-a, --all-versions / -na, --no-all-versions` - If enabled, all version tags will be checked. This may include alpha, beta
or release candidate versions. Keep in mind that this option is not the same as `-b, --bleeding-edge`!


- `-v, --verbose / -nv, --no-verbose` - If enabled, every detail will be printed out once the process completes. This
does not display warnings if they are disabled (`-nw, --no-warnings`)!

    > [!tip]
    > Use the `--verbose` option if you want to see the complete update output e.g. `--keep` and `--exclude`.


- `-w, --warnings / -nw, --no-warnings` - If enabled, various validation warnings will be displayed (mostly configuration issues)


- `-p, --preview / -np, --no-preview` - This option excludes all other options if enabled! It is used in order to display the
configuration priorities/overwrites between default configuration, `pyproject.toml` configuration and options passed directly
to the cli. It also displays the final configuration and what was changed.


- `-j, --jobs` - This option sets the maximum number of worker jobs (threads). If left blank, value used will equal to your `cpu_count + 4`


- `-e, --exclude` - This option, if used, excludes the complete repo (along with all the hooks) from update check. That means that the given
repo url (for the given `REPO_URL_TRIM`) will be completely skipped. You can exclude multiple repos by repeating the option multiple times
(example: `--exclude black --exclude isort`). You can also use a wildcard `*` (example: `--exclude '*'`) in order to exclude every single repo
from the update process. This is useful when, for example, your python version is not up-to-date, and you need time to upgrade your code before
updating your hooks to their latest versions.

    > [!important]
    > Using a wildcard with the `--exclude` option disables the `--keep` and `--bleeding-edge` options
  

- `-k, --keep` - This option, if used, keeps the current repo version/hash (along with all the hooks). That means that the given
repo url (for the given `REPO_URL_TRIM`) will fetch available updates and display them, but no update will take place. You can keep multiple
repos by repeating the option multiple times (example: `--keep black --keep isort`). You can also use a wildcard `*` (example: `--keep '*'`)
in order to keep every single repo pinned to the current version while also checking for updates.

    > [!important]
    > Using a wildcard with the `--keep` option disables the `--exclude` option
  

- `-b, --bleeding-edge` - This option, if used, gets the latest repo version/hash (whatever is more recent). That means that the given
repo url (for the given `REPO_URL_TRIM`) will be updated to the latest tagged version **OR** latest commit, depending on which one is more recent. This
also means that `--bleeding-edge` option **ignores** the `--all-versions` option - it will always fetch the latest update - stable or not.
You can set multiple repos as `--bleeding-edge` by repeating the option multiple times (example: `--bleeding-edge black --bleeding-edge isort`).
You can also use a wildcard `*` (example: `--bleeding-edge '*'`) in order to update every single repo to the latest version/hash.

    > [!important]
    > Using a wildcard with the `--bleeding-edge` option disables the `--exclude` option


- `-t, --tag-prefix` - This option, if used, sets custom tag prefix schema for the specified repos. This is useful if your repo has custom tags for pre-commit.
For example, if `REPO_URL_TRIM` `black` has tags as `pre-commit-tag-v0.1.1`, you can use `--tag-prefix` as `--tag-prefix black pre-commit-tag-v`.
You can set multiple custom tag schemas for multiple repos with `--tag-prefix` option by repeating the option multiple times
(example: `--tag-prefix black custom-version-v --tag-prefix isort another-schema-v`).

    > [!important]
    > Be careful to pass the complete prefix (for `pre-commit-tag-v0.1.1` prefix would be `pre-commit-tag-v`)


- `-V, --version` - Displays the current version of `pre-commit-update`.


- `-h, --help` - Displays all the available options along with the short description of each.

### 1) Pipeline usage example
#### a) GitLab job:

```yaml
pre-commit-hooks-update:
  stage: update
  script:
    # install git if not present in the image
    - pip install pre-commit-update
    - pre-commit-update --dry-run
  except:
    - main
  when: manual
  allow_failure: true
```

> [!note]
> This is just an example, feel free to do your own configuration

### 2) pre-commit hook usage example

You can also use `pre-commit-update` as a hook in your `pre-commit` hooks:

```yaml
- repo: https://gitlab.com/vojko.pribudic.foss/pre-commit-update
  rev: v0.9.0  # Insert the latest tag here
  hooks:
    - id: pre-commit-update
      # Example args (use your own configuration)
      args: [--dry-run, --exclude, black, --keep, isort, --tag-prefix, black, custom-version-v]
```

> [!note]
> This is just an example, feel free to do your own configuration

## 5. Configuration

You can configure `pre-commit-update` in your `pyproject.toml` as below (do your own configuration):

Example:
```toml
[tool.pre-commit-update]
dry_run = true
dry_run_mode = "strict"
all_versions = false
verbose = true
warnings = true
preview = false
jobs = 10
exclude = ["isort"]
keep = ["black"]
bleeding_edge = ["pylint"]
tag_prefix = [["black", "custom-tag-schema-v"]]
```

> [!note]
> If some of the options are missing (for example `--exclude` option), `pre-commit-update`
> will use the default value for that option (default for `--exclude` option would be an empty list).

> [!important]
> If you invoke `pre-commit-update` with any options (e.g. `pre-commit-update -d`),
> `pyproject.toml` configuration will be **overridden**. This means that all the options passed while
> calling `pre-commit-update` will have priority over the configuration defined inside `pyproject.toml`.
> If you want to override boolean options, you can do so by passing the negative option value.
> For example, given the configuration above, to override `--verbose` option from `pyproject.toml`, you
> would invoke `pre-commit-update` with either `--no-verbose` or `-nv`.

You can always check the configuration overrides (priorities) by running `pre-commit-update -p` / `pre-commit-update --preview`

### 1) YAML output configuration

You can configure the output of `pre-commit-update` resulting YAML in your `pyproject.toml` as below (do your own configuration):

Example:
```toml
[tool.pre-commit-update.yaml]
mapping = 4
sequence = 4
offset = 2
```

> [!note]
> `pre-commit-update` does not directly format the resulting YAML file.
> It is done by the `ruamel.yaml` library. You can find more information about the configuration options [here.](https://yaml.dev/doc/ruamel.yaml)

> [!caution]
> This is an experimental feature and may change in the future. Reasoning is defined [here.](https://gitlab.com/vojko.pribudic.foss/pre-commit-update/-/issues/19)

## 6. F.A.Q

### 1) New version of pre-commit-update has a bug, what should I do?

These things do happen, unfortunately. Please report your issue(s) [here](https://gitlab.com/vojko.pribudic.foss/pre-commit-update/-/issues).

If you are using `pre-commit-update` as a pre-commit hook and the previous version 
of `pre-commit-update` worked for you, you can pin that specific version in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
To do so, just add the following in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
- repo: https://gitlab.com/vojko.pribudic.foss/pre-commit-update
  rev: v0.8.0  # Version that works for you
  hooks:
    - id: pre-commit-update
      args: [--keep, pre-commit-update]
```

If you are using `pre-commit-update` as a CLI, you can downgrade to the previous version by running:

```console
$ python -m pip install pre-commit-update==vX.X.X
```

Replace the `X.X.X` with the previous version that worked for you.

### 2) There are certain icons in the output messages, what do they mean?

`pre-commit-update` uses the following icons/text in the output messages:

- `⚠`, `▲`, `[warning]` - Indicates that a message is a warning
- `✔`, `√`, `[no-update]` - Indicates that there is no need to update the hook
- `✘`, `×`, `[update]` - Indicates that hook needs to be updated
- `⧣`, `≠`, `[hash]` - Indicates that the hook is using a hash instead of a tag
- `★`, `*`, `[exclude]` - Indicates that the hook is excluded from the update process
- `◉`, `●`, `[keep]` - Indicates that the hook will check for updates but will not be updated
- `↯`, `±`, `[bleeding-edge]` - Indicates that the hook is using bleeding edge version/hash
- `⇉`, `»`, `[tag-prefix]` - Indicates that the hook is using custom tag prefix schema

Some terminals support the Unicode icons (first set), some support universal icons (second set) and some do not 
support either (third set).

`pre-commit-update` will fallback to whatever is supported by the terminal you use.
