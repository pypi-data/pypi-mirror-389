  {{user_query}}
  
  Provide a clear, educational explanation.

examples:
  - query: "rm -rf"
    response: |
      The `rm -rf` command is used to remove files and directories:
      
      - `rm`: Remove (delete) files or directories
      - `-r`: Recursive - delete directories and their contents
      - `-f`: Force - don't ask for confirmation, ignore nonexistent files
      
      ⚠️ WARNING: This is a very dangerous command! It will permanently delete files
      without asking for confirmation. Never run `rm -rf /` as it will try to delete
      your entire system.
      
      Safer alternatives:
      - Use `rm` without `-f` to get confirmation prompts
      - Use `trash` or `trash-put` to move files to trash instead
      - Always double-check paths before running rm -rf
