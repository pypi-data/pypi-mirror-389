This module notifies users of the group *Billing Administrator* when
currency rates are older than 3 days (this default number of days can be
modified).

|image1|

When Odoo converts an amount to another currency at date D in company C,
it takes the currency rate of company C (or with an empty *Company*
field) that is dated date D or the closest rate before date D. But Odoo
doesn't say anything when there is no rate on date D and the closest
rate before date D is far away in the past. This is a real problem
because the converted amount may be irrelevant!

This module provides a daily monitoring of the necessity to always have
up-to-date rates in your Odoo database.

If the user is allowed in several companies, the notification pop-up
will display, for each currency, in which companies the lastest rate is
too old.
