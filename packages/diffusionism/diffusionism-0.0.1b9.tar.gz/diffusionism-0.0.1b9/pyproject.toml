description = "Diffusionism is a Python library for rapid prototyping and deployment of diffusion models. It provides a flexible, inheritance-based architecture, allowing easy integration of new methods, with built-in pipelines for training and inference. It accelerates development and ensures reproducibility by separating general mechanics from model-specific logic."
