# Define the class "Cleaner"
class Cleaner:
    """
    Class for references management. It keeps track of the names of the global variables to be deleted and deletes them when ordered.
    
    The cleaning process only deletes the flagged references to objects, but doesn't directly force the garbage collector to destroy the objects they are pointing to.
    
    ---
    ## WARNING
    THERE CAN ONLY BE **ONE** CLEANER OBJECT.\n
    Initializing a new one will delete all global references to the previous one.
    
    ---
    Attributes:
        _not_delete (`list[str]`, Hidden): List of variables to never delete from memory. These cannot be included in the process even if ordered so.\n
            These mainly are variables needed for the system to work and imports.
        _excluded (`list[str]`, Hidden): List of variables excluded from the memory cleaning that can be included again if desired.
        _flagged (`list[str]`, Hidden): List of variables to erase from memory. Variables can be put in and/or taken out through methods.
    ---
    
    ## Methods
        :update: *`MethodType`*
        Updates the list of variables to erase from memory including all the new variables global variables not manually excluded.\n
            It also allows to incorporate previously excluded variables.
        :exclude: *`MethodType`*
        Allows you to exclude variables from the cleaning process without need to use the `instance.update()` method.
        :include: *`MethodType`*
        Allows you to include variables in the cleaning process without need to use the `instance.update()` method.
        :clean: *`MethodType`*
        Erases all the flagged references from memory.
    ---
    
    ## Properties
        :not_delete: *`MethodType`*, *Getter*
        Returns the list of variables that shouldn't be deleted and can't be included in the cleaning process.
        :excluded: *`MethodType`*, *Getter*
        Returns the list of variables excluded from the cleaning process but can be included again if ordered.
        :flagged: *`MethodType`*, *Getter*
        Returns the list of variables to be erased from memory.
    None of this properties has setter or deleter. Those lists can only be manipulated through the class methods.
