**sed-processor** is a backend to process and bin multidimensional single-event datastreams, with the intended primary use case in multidimensional photoelectron spectroscopy using time-of-flight instruments.

It builds on [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) dataframes, where each column represents a multidimensional "coordinate" such as position, time-of-flight, pump-probe delay etc., and each entry represents one electron. The `SedProcessor` class provides a single user entry point, and provides functions for handling various workflows for coordinate transformation, e.g. corrections and calibrations.

Furthermore, "sed-processor" provides fast and parallelized binning routines to compute multidimensional histograms from the processed dataframes in a delayed fashion, thus reducing requirements on cpu power and memory consumption.

Finally, in contains several export routines, including export into the [NeXus](https://www.nexusformat.org/) format with rich and standardized metadata annotation.

# Installation

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- pip

## Steps
- Create a new virtual environment using either venv, pyenv, conda, etc. See below for an example.

```bash
python -m venv .sed-venv
```

- Activate your environment:

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
source .sed-venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
.sed-venv\Scripts\activate
```

- Install `sed`, distributed as `sed-processor` on PyPI:

```bash
pip install sed-processor[all]
```

- If you intend to work with Jupyter notebooks, it is helpful to install a Jupyter kernel for your environment. This can be done, once your environment is activated, by typing:

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=sed_kernel
```

- If you do not use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab, you can skip the installing those dependencies

```bash
pip install sed-processor
```
