      description:
        Firmware Over The Air (FoTA) enables remote firmware updates for embedded devices,
        ensuring security, feature deployment, and bug fixes without physical access.
        KeySTREAM is a secure, cloud-based platform that streamlines FoTA management for
        IoT devices. Using KeySTREAM with ECC608-TMNGTLS enhances device reliability and
        security, reduces operational costs, and allows efficient large-scale fleet
        management and continuous product improvement."
