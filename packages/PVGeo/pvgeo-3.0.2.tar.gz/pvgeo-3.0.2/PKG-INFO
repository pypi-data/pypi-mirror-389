# *PVGeo*



The *PVGeo* Python package contains VTK powered tools for data visualization in
geophysics which are wrapped for direct use with
[**PyVista**](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista). These tools are tailored to
data visualization in the geosciences with a heavy focus on structured data sets
like 2D or 3D time-varying grids.

## Demonstrations of *PVGeo*

For a quick overview of how *PVGeo* can be used, checkout the code snippets and
videos on the [**About Examples Page**](https://pvgeo.org/about-examples.html)

## Connections

This package provides many VTK-like algorithms designed for geoscientific data
formats and types to perform data integration and analysis.
To ensure our users have powerful and easy to use tools that can visualize the
results of PVGeo algorithms, we are actively involved in the development of
[**PyVista**](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista): a toolset for easy access to
VTK data objects and 3D visualization in Python.
To learn more about pairing PVGeo with PyVista, please check out the
[**example Jupyter notebooks**](https://github.com/OpenGeoVis/PVGeo-Examples).

## Getting Started

To begin using the *PVGeo* Python package, create/activate your Python virtual
environment (we highly recommend using anaconda) and install *PVGeo* through pip:

```bash
pip install PVGeo
```

Now *PVGeo* is ready for use in your standard Python environment (>=3.9)
with all dependencies installed! Go ahead and test your install:

```bash
python -c "import PVGeo; print(PVGeo.__version__)"
```

Further insight can be found in the [**Getting Started Guide**](http://pvgeo.org/overview/getting-started.html).

## Report Issues and Contribute

Please feel free to post features you would like to see from this package on the
[**issues page**](https://github.com/OpenGeoVis/PVGeo/issues) as a feature
request.
If you stumble across any bugs or crashes while using code distributed here,
report them in the issues section so we can promptly address it.
For other questions, join the [***PVGeo* community on Slack**](http://slack.pvgeo.org).

## About the Authors [![Open Source](https://img.shields.io/badge/open--source-yes-brightgreen.svg)](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)

The *PVGeo* code library was created and is managed by [**Bane Sullivan**](http://banesullivan.com),
graduate student in the Hydrological Science and Engineering interdisciplinary
program at the Colorado School of Mines under Whitney Trainor-Guitton.
If you would like to contact us, inquire with [**info@pvgeo.org**](mailto:info@pvgeo.org).

It is important to note the project is open source and that many features in
this repository were made possible by contributors volunteering their time.

### Citing PVGeo

There is a [paper about PVGeo](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01451)!

for more details.

## Linking PVGeo to ParaView

While PVGeo was previously design to be used as plugins directly in ParaView, we are
unable to maintain support for ParaView and recommend using PyVista instead.
