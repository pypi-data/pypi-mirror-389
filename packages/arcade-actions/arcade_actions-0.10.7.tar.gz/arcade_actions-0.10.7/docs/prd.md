# 📄 ArcadeActions Extension Library Requirements Document

---

## ✅ Project Overview

The goal is to create a robust, **conditional Actions system for the Arcade 3.x Python library**, inspired by Cocos2D's action system but reimagined to fit Arcade's API.

This system enables complex sprite behaviors (movement, rotation, scaling, fading, scheduling) in games like Space Invaders, Galaga, and Asteroids — all using high-level declarative **condition-based actions** that work directly with Arcade's native sprites.

## 🔄 Property Update System

The Actions library uses **direct property updates** with Arcade's native sprite system:

### Direct Property Updates
All actions work by directly modifying sprite properties:
- **Position** - Updated via `center_x`, `center_y` 
- **Angle** - Updated via `angle` property
- **Scale** - Updated via `scale` property (supports both float and tuple)
- **Alpha** - Updated via `alpha` property

Actions calculate velocity-based changes and apply them directly:
1. Actions calculate position/angle/scale/alpha changes based on velocity and delta_time
2. Actions apply changes directly to sprite properties
3. Actions check conditions each frame to determine completion
4. Global `Action.update_all()` handles all active actions automatically

### Condition-Based Paradigm
Unlike duration-based actions, ArcadeActions uses **condition-based actions**:
- **MoveUntil** - Move until condition is met
- **RotateUntil** - Rotate until condition is met
- **FadeUntil** - Fade until condition is met
- **DelayUntil** - Wait until condition is met

This enables more flexible, game-state-driven behaviors.

### Pattern 2: Operator-Based Composition
```python
from actions import move_until, rotate_until, fade_until, infinite

# Clean declarative syntax with operators
# Unbound actions can be created by passing `None` as the target
move = move_until(None, velocity=(100, 0), condition=infinite)
rotate = rotate_until(None, velocity=1.5, condition=infinite)

seq = move + rotate
par = move | rotate
complex_action = delay + (move | fade) + final_action

# Apply the composed action to a target
complex_action.apply(sprite)
```

### Pattern 3: Global Management
```python
# Single update handles all actions
def on_update(self, delta_time):
    Action.update_all(delta_time)
```

## 🏗️ Code Quality Standards

### Core Design Principle: Zero Tolerance for Runtime Type Checking

**ZERO TOLERANCE for runtime type/attribute checking** - This includes:
- `hasattr()` for type discrimination
- `getattr()` with defaults for missing attributes
- `isinstance()` for runtime type checking
- EAFP with exception silencing (`except AttributeError: pass`)

**The Real Problem**: Unclear interfaces, not the checking pattern.

**The Solution**: Design interfaces so checking isn't needed through:
1. **Consistent base interfaces** with well-defined contracts
2. **Clear protocols** guaranteeing expected methods/attributes exist
3. **Composition patterns** eliminating optional attributes
4. **Unified interfaces** for similar objects (Action base class)

### Implementation Standards

1. **Global Action Management**: All actions must use the global `Action.update_all()` system
2. **Condition-Based Design**: Actions must be condition-based, not duration-based
3. **Native Sprite Compatibility**: Must work with standard `arcade.Sprite` and `arcade.SpriteList`
4. **Function Composition**: Support `sequence()` and `parallel()` for clean action combination
5. **Tag-Based Organization**: Support tagged action management for complex behaviors
6. **Clean API Design**: Minimize wrapper methods and prefer direct action application

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **No Custom Sprite Classes**: Works directly with `arcade.Sprite` - no ActionSprite needed
2. **Global Management**: Central `Action` class manages all active actions automatically  
3. **Condition-Based**: Actions run until conditions are met, enabling state-driven behavior
4. **Composition Helpers**: Helper functions create composite actions cleanly
5. **Formation Pattern**: Position sprites in organized layouts without replacing core Arcade classes

## 🎯 Core Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Action Application
```python
from actions import infinite, move_until

# Works with any arcade.Sprite or arcade.SpriteList
sprite = arcade.Sprite("image.png")
enemies = arcade.SpriteList()

move_until(sprite, velocity=(100, 0), condition=lambda: sprite.center_x > 700)
move_until(enemies, velocity=(100, 0), condition=infinite)
```

### Pattern 2: Operator-Based Composition
```python
from actions import infinite, move_until, rotate_until, fade_until

# Clean declarative syntax with operators
# Unbound actions can be created by passing `None` as the target
move = move_until(None, velocity=(100, 0), condition=infinite)
rotate = rotate_until(None, velocity=1.5, condition=infinite)

seq = move + rotate
par = move | rotate
complex_action = delay + (move | fade) + final_action

# Apply the composed action to a target
complex_action.apply(sprite)
```

### Pattern 3: Global Management
```python
from actions import Action

# Single update handles all actions
def on_update(self, delta_time):
    Action.update_all(delta_time)
```

### Pattern 4: Formation Functions for Layout
```python
from actions import arrange_grid
arrange_grid(enemies, rows=3, cols=5, start_x=100, start_y=400)
```

#### Zero-Allocation Gameplay (Experimental)

To eliminate per-wave allocations, pre-allocate sprites and reuse:

```python
from actions.pools import SpritePool
from actions import arrange_grid
import arcade

def make_enemy():
    return arcade.Sprite(":resources:images/enemies/bee.png", scale=0.5)

pool = SpritePool(make_enemy, max_size=300)
wave = pool.acquire(20)
arrange_grid(sprites=wave, rows=4, cols=5, start_x=100, start_y=400)
pool.release(wave)
```

Arrange function contract updates:
- Provide exactly one of `sprites` or creation inputs (`count` / `sprite_factory`)
- For grids, `len(sprites) == rows * cols` when `sprites` is supplied

This architecture provides a clean, powerful, and maintainable action system that enhances Arcade without replacing its core functionality.
