# Changelog
An entry for each version should be available in here. Version number follows the pattern
M.m.b, i.e. Major, minor, and bugfix. If the version ends with the literal a or b it means
that the released version is an alpha- (for internal testing) or a beta-version (for
external testing).

Each entry has to feature at least one of the following sections: Added, Changed, Removed
and Fixed. If no item is present for a given section, omit it or have it say n/a or None.
Optional additional sections are: Patched | Known Issues.

### V0.1.0
