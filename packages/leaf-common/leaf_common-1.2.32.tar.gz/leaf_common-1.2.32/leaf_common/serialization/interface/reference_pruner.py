class ReferencePruner():
    """
    An interface whose implementations know how to prune/graft repeat
    references to objects within an object hierarchy defined by a single root
    object.

    In an ideal persisted object hierarchy, there would already be no reference
    cycles and the notion of a ReferencePruner would not be needed at all.
    Strive to eliminate the need for ReferencePruners at all in your code.
