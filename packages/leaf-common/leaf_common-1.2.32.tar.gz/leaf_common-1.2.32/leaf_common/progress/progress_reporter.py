class ProgressReporter:
    """
    An interface for reporting progress

    def report(self, progress: Dict[str, Any]):
        """
        Report the given progress dictionary as the
        lowest level of progress context/scope that
        has no notion of context/scope that it happens
        to be nested within (if at all).

        You can think of this as a kind of print statement
        that you would sprinkle throughout a single method
        with many phases, reporting on the progress of that
        method.

        Client code should only be concerned with its own
        limited progress context/scope for its own procedures.

        Implementations are expected to have references to
        parent ProgressReporter contexts/scopes so that placement
        within a broader, nested progress context/scope can be done
        without specifically worrying about the data details
        of those broader contexts/scopes.

        :param progress: A single, un-nested progress dictionary,
                limited in scope to the progressing procedure at hand.
