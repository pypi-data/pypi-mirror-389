        :param base_name: The base name of the file.
                This does *not* include the ".yaml" extension.
        :param folder: The folder in which the file is to be persisted.
        :param must_exist: Default False.  When True, an error is
                raised when the file does not exist upon restore()
                When False, the lack of a file to restore from is
                ignored and a dictionary value of None is returned
        :param object_type: A string indicating the type of object to be
                persisted. "dict" by default.
        :param dictionary_converter: An implementation of a DictionaryConverter
                to use when converting the yaml to/from a dictionary.
                Default value of None implies that a
                PassThroughDictionaryConverter will be used, which does not
                modify the dictionary at all.
        :param use_file_extension: Use the provided string instead of the
                standard file extension for the format. Default is None,
                indicating the standard file extension for the format should
                be used.
        :param full_ref: A full file reference to be broken apart into
                consituent pieces for purposes of persistence.
