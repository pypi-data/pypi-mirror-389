    Interface for modifying a config dictionary.

    This interface is meant to be generic enough to that multiple
    implementations could be chained together.

    Ideally, implementations would take no arguments in their constructor,
    thus allowing config modification at an early stage in an app's lifecyle.

        Ideally this would be a Pure Function in that it would not
