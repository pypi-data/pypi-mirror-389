## Textile Image Dataset

This package provides the simulated textile images used in\
**[Megahed et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12596)** for
few-shot CLIP classification experiments.

These images were originally generated using the R script below and were
previously released under an MIT License in our repository:

### Dataset Summary

To systematically evaluate CLIP's performance on STS image
classification, we used the **spc4sts** R package to create a controlled
dataset of simulated textile fabric textures. This approach allowed us
to precisely model both nominal and defective weave structures and to
control defect type and severity.

Our dataset contains:

  Class            Description                             Count
  ---------------- --------------------------------------- -----------
  Nominal          Standard textile weave patterns         **1,000**
  Local defects    Localized disruptions in the weave      **500**
  Global defects   Systematic shifts in weave parameters   **500**

Each image is **250 × 250 px**, generated using `spc4sts` recommended
parameters:

-   **Nominal images:**\
    Spatial autoregressive parameters ϕ₁ = 0.6, ϕ₂ = 0.35

-   **Global defects:**\
    Both parameters reduced by **5%**

-   **Local defects:**\
    Generated using the package's defect-insertion functions
