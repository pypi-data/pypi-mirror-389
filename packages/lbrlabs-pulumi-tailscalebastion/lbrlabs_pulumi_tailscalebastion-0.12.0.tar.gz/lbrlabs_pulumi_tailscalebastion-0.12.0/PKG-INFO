# Pulumi Tailscale Bastion

This repo provides a [multi-language](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/pulumiup-pulumi-packages-multi-language-components/) component that creates a [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) [Subnet Router](https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets/) in your chosen cloud provider

## Examples

Examples for all languages are in the [examples](examples/) directory. 

Note, you need to create a VPC, and also add your worker nodes. 

## FAQs

### Can you add support for X

Add an issue, but this is mainly designed to be useful for cloud providers I use, so I reserve the right to refuse.

### Can you make X optional?

I have no plans to make any of the batteries included optional at this time
