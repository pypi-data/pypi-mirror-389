# Changelog

## 2.1.0

- Enhancement: Use tables in the generated sphinx code for topic/domains.
  [jensens, 02-11-2025]
- Feature: Add monorepo support with `PROJECT_PATH_PYTHON` setting.
  Python projects can now be located in subdirectories while keeping the Makefile at the repository root. Includes auto-detection of `pyproject.toml` in subdirectories on init, `--project-path-python` CLI flag and preseed file support.
  Useful for monorepos with multiple applications (e.g., frontend + backend).
  See the "Monorepo Support" section in getting-started.md for details.
- Feature: Add `--version` (`-v`) command line flag to display mxmake version.
  [jensens, 02-11-2025]

- Fix: All QA tool domains (ruff, isort, mypy, black, zpretty, pyupgrade, pyrefly) now respect the `PROJECT_PATH_PYTHON` setting when using default source paths.
  When `PROJECT_PATH_PYTHON` is set (e.g., to `backend`), the tools automatically look for source code in the correct subdirectory (e.g., `backend/src`) instead of just `src`.
  [jensens, 03-11-2025]

## 2.0.0 (2025-10-24)

- **Breaking**: Drop Python 3.9 support. Minimum Python version is now 3.10.
- Feature: Modernize codebase to use Python 3.10+ features (PEP 604 union types, built-in generic types).
- **Critical fix**: `SOURCES_TARGET` used mxdev wrongly with `-o` (offline) option.
  The offline option had a bug and was fixed in mxdev [#34](https://github.com/mxstack/mxdev/issues/34) and released with mxdev>=5.
  This fix switches from `-o` to the correct `-f` (no fetch from vcs).
  To update your makefile use `mxmake update` in the folder with your `Makefile`.
- Fix: theme for newer Sphinx 7.x.
- Fix: interactive uv venv, use `--allow-existing` instead.
- Fix: The project was using `pytest` as the test runner all along (as configured in the Makefile and generated test scripts), but `zope.testrunner `was incorrectly listed as the dependency.
- Feature: Add support for Python 3.14.
- Breaking: Removed `MXENV_UV_GLOBAL` setting in favor of automatic UV detection.
  When `PYTHON_PACKAGE_INSTALLER=uv`, mxmake now automatically detects and uses
  a globally installed `uv` if available. To force local installation of uv,
  simply don't install it globally or remove it from PATH.
- Feature: Add `UV_PYTHON` setting to specify Python version for UV-managed virtual
  environments. Defaults to `PRIMARY_PYTHON` for backward compatibility. This
  provides semantic clarity: `PRIMARY_PYTHON` is the system interpreter path
  (e.g., `python3.11`), while `UV_PYTHON` is the version spec for UV
  (e.g., `3.14`, `cpython@3.14`).
- Feature: Automatic detection of global UV installation using simple shell check.
  No manual configuration required.
- Feature: All UV commands now run with `--quiet --no-progress` flags for better
  CI/CD compatibility and cleaner log output.
- Feature: When using global UV, mxmake checks if updates are available using
  `uv self update --dry-run` and displays a helpful non-blocking warning if a
  newer version is available.
- Improvement: Simplified mxenv.mk logic from 3+ nesting levels to 1-2 levels
  using computed intermediate variables (`USE_GLOBAL_UV`, `USE_LOCAL_UV`).
  Code is now more maintainable and easier to extend.
- Tests/CI: Add UV-only CI job testing workflow without Python pre-installation.
  New `uv-only` job in variants workflow verifies that `make install` works
  with only UV installed (no Python) on Python 3.10 and 3.14, proving the
  UV-only team workflow documented in getting-started.md.
- Docs: Complete overhaul of installation documentation. Document UV-only workflow
  requiring no Python pre-installation. Simplify UV configuration examples to show
  only required settings (PYTHON_PACKAGE_INSTALLER and UV_PYTHON). Add migration guide,
  FAQ/troubleshooting section, and clarify when PYTHON_MIN_VERSION/PRIMARY_PYTHON
  settings are needed vs. optional.
- Chore: Migrate to hatch-vcs for automated versioning from git tags.

  sub make calls.

- Add `LINGUA_OPTIONS` setting to `lingua` domain in `i18n` topic. Can be used
  for passing additional command line options to `pot-create`.

- Perform `mxenv` domain related checks inside target to support setups
  which install their own python environment.

- Add `Makefile` as dependency target for `SENTINEL` target to make sure
  target execution if Makefile changes.

- Depend on `mxdev>=4.0.2`, which fixes the deprecation of `pkg_resources` and
  use the provided infrastructure of mxdev to handle entry_points in mxmake.

- Add Plone site creation and purging in new `plone` domain.

  `--checkout` option.

- Add phony target `cookiecutter` to be able to just install it.

- Add feature to pass options to zest-releaser commands.

- Change default for venv folder to `.venv`, since this is established practice.

- Support custom makefile include.

- Support `pytest` as a test runner and make it default if not configured
  otherwise.

  `Makefile`.

- Create `twisted` domain in `applications` topic.

- Test and coverage templates consider `mxmake-test-path`, `mxmake-source-path`
  and `mxmake-omit-path` in `settings` section of `mx.ini` to support inclusion
  of local package in `run-tests.sh` and `run-coverage.sh` scripts.

- Create `scss` domain in `js` topic.

- Create `gettext` domain in `i18n` topic.

- Create `lingua` domain in `i18n` topic.

- Conditional add local [requirement|constraints}.txt to LOCAL_PACKAGE_FILES.

- Create `npm` domains in `js` topic.

- Create `jsdoc` domain, in `docs` topic.

- Create `rollup` domains in `js` topic.

- Create `karma` domain, in `js` topic.

- Create `zope` domain, in `applications` topic.

- Add `soft-depends` setting in domains to define conditional order of domain
  rendering.

- Make `sources` target an optional dependency.

- Extend makefile parser to provide multi line settings.

- Take local package into account to "dirty" if there (pyproject.toml,
  setup.[cfg|py]

- Check for the existence of pip in `*-clean` targets before uninstalling a
  package, to ensure the targets are working when running via the default
  `clean` target, where the entire virtual env gets removed.

- Remove redundant dependencies from `zope` domain.

- `sources` domain is now a soft dependency of `mxfiles` domain instead of the
  `packages` domain. This ensures source package checkout happens before mxmake
  generates files, because templates might gain information from source
  packages if present.

- `karma` and `rollup` targets depend on `NPM_TARGET` now.
