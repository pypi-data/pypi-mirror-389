To use this module, go to Timesheets > Configuration > Predefined Descriptions.

Create or edit a predefined description and configure:

#. Allow Free Text: lets users add additional text.
#. Free Text Required: forces users to fill in additional text.
#. Append Free Text to Name: appends the additional text to the description name.

These features only work if the analytic line is linked to a task or ticket.
