## Installation

### MacOS

If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on your machine you can install by running:

```
    brew install svtplay-dl
```
You will need to run `brew install ffmpeg` afterwards, if you don't already have one of these packages.

### Debian and Ubuntu

svtplay-dl is available in Debian strech and later and on Ubuntu 16.04 and later, which means you can install it straight away using apt. The version in their repo is often old and thus we **strongly** recommend using our own apt repo, which always include the latest version. The svtplay-dl repo for Debian / Ubuntu can be found at [apt.svtplay-dl.se](https://apt.svtplay-dl.se/).

##### Add the release PGP keys:
```
    curl -s https://svtplay-dl.se/release-key.txt | sudo apt-key add -
```

##### Add the "release" channel to your APT sources:
```
    echo "deb https://apt.svtplay-dl.se/ svtplay-dl release" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/svtplay-dl.list
```

##### Update and install svtplay-dl:
```
    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get install svtplay-dl
```

4. cd path\to\svtplay-dl && mkdir build
5. `pip install -e .`

7. `python %PYTHON%\\Scripts\\cxfreeze --include-modules=cffi,queue,idna.idnadata --target-dir=build bin/svtplay-dl`
8. Find binary in build folder. you need `svtplay-dl.exe` and `pythonXX.dll` from that folder to run `svtplay-dl.exe`

```

```

### From source

If packaging isn’t available for your operating system, or you want to
use a non-released version, you’ll want to install from source. Use git
to download the sources:

```
    git clone https://github.com/spaam/svtplay-dl
```

svtplay-dl requires the following additional tools and libraries. They
are usually available from your distribution’s package repositories. If
you don’t have them, some features will not be working.

-  [Python](https://www.python.org) 3.6 or higher
-  [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest) to download encrypted HLS streams
-  [PyYaml](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml) for configure file
-  [Requests](https://2.python-requests.org)
-  [PySocks](https://github.com/Anorov/PySocks) to enable proxy support
-  [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) for postprocessing and/or for DASH streams ([ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com) for Windows)

##### To install it, run:

```
    sudo python3 setup.py install
```

## After install

    svtplay-dl [options] URL
```
