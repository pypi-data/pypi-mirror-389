"""
System validation tests for cascadeflow multi-signal confidence fixes.

These tests verify that all critical fixes are correctly applied:
1. Alignment scorer accepts 3-letter words (len(w) > 2)
2. Confidence estimator supports multi-signal mode
3. Providers have intelligent logprobs defaults
4. All components integrate correctly
