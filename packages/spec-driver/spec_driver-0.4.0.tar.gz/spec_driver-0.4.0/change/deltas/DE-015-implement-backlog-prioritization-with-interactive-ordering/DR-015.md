# DR-015 – Implement backlog prioritization with interactive ordering

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Delta**: [DE-015](./DE-015.md)
- **Status**: draft (update when approved)
- **Owners / Team**: <names or teams accountable>
- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-04
- **Synopsis**: <one-liner describing the architectural shift>

## 2. Problem & Constraints
- **Current Behaviour**: <describe pain, instability, or limitation>
- **Drivers / Inputs**: <link research, decisions, audits that justify the work>
- **Constraints / Guardrails**: <operational limits, rollout boundaries, observability, compliance>
- **Out of Scope**: <explicit non-goals, deferred ideas>

## 3. Architecture Intent
- **Target Outcomes**:
  - <Outcome 1 tied to requirement/spec>
  - <Outcome 2>
- **Guiding Principles**: <service boundaries, coupling choices, failure modes>
- **State Transitions / Lifecycle Impact**: <how lifecycle/status values evolve>

## 4. Code Impact Summary
| Path | Current State | Target State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/example/module.py` | <behaviour today> | <behaviour after change> |

> Capture each affected component with concise before/after statements. Align this table with the `code_impacts` frontmatter entries.

## 5. Verification Alignment
| Verification | Impact | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VT-XXX | regression | <existing coverage that must be updated> |
| VA-YYY | new | <new artefact or analysis to add> |

> Keep the table in sync with `verification_alignment` metadata so tooling can audit impacts.

## 6. Supporting Context
- **Research**: RC-### – <insight or takeaway>
- **Hypotheses**: PROD-###.HYP-## – <assumption being validated>
- **Related Deltas / Specs**: DE-###, SPEC-### – <traceability notes>

## 7. Design Decisions & Trade-offs
- DEC-### – <decision summary, rationale, consequences>
- <Additional decisions, even if pending approval>

## 8. Open Questions
- [ ] Question text – Owner (@name) – due YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] …

## 9. Rollout & Operational Notes
- **Migration / Backfill**: <data movements, toggles, sequencing>
- **Observability / Alerts**: <metrics, telemetry changes, dashboards>
- **Recovery / Rollback**: <how to detect bad rollout and undo>

## 10. References & Links
- Diagrams: <link to draw.io/miro>
- Demo / Prototype: <link>
- Additional Reading: <links>

> Keep this document as the living design record for the delta. Update frontmatter fields (`owners`, `code_impacts`, `verification_alignment`, `design_decisions`, `open_questions`) as the design evolves.
