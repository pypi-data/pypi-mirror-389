## About

The CrateDB MCP Server for natural-language Text-to-SQL and documentation
retrieval specializes in CrateDB database clusters.
The Model Context Protocol ([MCP][MCP home]) is a protocol that standardizes providing
context to language models and AI assistants.

The CrateDB Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server connects AI assistants directly
to your CrateDB clusters and the CrateDB knowledge base, enabling seamless
interaction through natural language.

It serves as a bridge between AI tools and your analytics database,
allowing you to analyze data, the cluster state, troubleshoot issues, and
perform operations using conversational prompts.
