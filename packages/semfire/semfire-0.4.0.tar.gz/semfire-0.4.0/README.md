# SemFire 

[![CI](https://github.com/Hyperceptron/SemFire/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Hyperceptron/SemFire/actions/workflows/test.yml)

 ## AI Deception Detection Toolkit

**SemFire (Semantic Firewall) is an open-source toolkit for detecting advanced AI deception, with a primary focus on "in-context scheming" and multi-turn manipulative attacks.** This project aims to develop tools to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities like the "Echo Chamber" and "Crescendo" attacks, where AI models are subtly guided towards undesirable behavior through conversational context.

### Project Vision: A Toolkit for AI Deception Detection

[History](./docs/context.md)

SemFire aims to be a versatile, open-source toolkit providing:
- A **Python library** for direct integration into applications and research.
- A **Command Line Interface (CLI)** for quick analysis and scripting.
- A **REST API service** (via FastAPI) for broader accessibility and enterprise use cases.
- Core components that can be integrated into broader semantic-firewall-like systems to monitor and analyze AI interactions in real-time.

## Features

 - Rule-based detector (`EchoChamberDetector`) for identifying cues related to "in-context scheming," context poisoning, semantic steering, and other multi-turn manipulative attack patterns (e.g., "Echo Chamber", "Crescendo").
 - Analyzes both current text input and conversation history to detect evolving deceptive narratives.
 - Heuristic-based detector (`HeuristicDetector`) for signals like text complexity and keyword usage.
 - ML-based classifiers to enhance detection of complex scheming behaviors over extended dialogues (Future Work).
 - Free API Image 
 - Enterprise API in Alpha 


## Installation
The project can be installed from PyPI:
```bash
pip install semfire
```

- **Quickstart :**[/docs/quickstart.md](./docs/quickstart.md)
- **Containerized CLI :** [/docs/docker-cli.md](./docs/docker-cli.md)

- **LLM Providers for ai-as-judge features :** [/docs/providers.md](./docs/providers.md)

## 🆕 ATT&CK v18 Navigator Integration (NEW!)

SemFire now supports MITRE ATT&CK v18 with Detection Strategies.

- Detection Strategies: 3 behavior-focused approaches
- Analytics: 8 platform-specific detections with tunable parameters
- Log Sources: 8 LLM-specific sources (v18 naming)
- Custom Techniques: T1656–T1659 for LLM attacks

Quick Start

```python
from integrations.navigator.semfire_navigator_v18_adapter import SemFireNavigatorV18Adapter
from datetime import datetime

adapter = SemFireNavigatorV18Adapter()
# ... run SemFire analysis ...
adapter.add_detection(result)

# NOTE: To avoid overwriting files, consider using a timestamp in the filename.
timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
output_filename = f"output_{timestamp}.json"
adapter.save_layer(output_filename)
```


<!-- Demo

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python integrations/navigator/examples/mitre_v18_demo.py
```

Load the generated layer in ATT&CK Navigator: https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/

Explore the interactive Streamlit UI for SemFire:

- URL: http://semfire-demo.streamlit.app/

Notes:
- The Streamlit UI lives in the companion repository under `demos/streamlit/` and uses this backend.
- For local development, run `streamlit run demos/streamlit/app.py` from the companion repo after installing this package.
