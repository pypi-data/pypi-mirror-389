# svine

Lightweight Python wrapper for a highly limited number of `svn` subcommands.
Meant for use in mining Subversion repositories.

## Installation

`pip install svine`

## Usage

Setup for all use cases is the same:

```python
from svine import SvnClient, SvnException

remote = SvnClient("https://svn.repository.url/whoever/still/uses/svn/")
```

### `svn log`

Returns log entries in named tuples with fields for message (`msg`), author, revision and date.

```python
try:
    for log_entry in remote.log():
        print(log_entry.msg)
except SvnException:
    # Handle
    pass

# Get latest log entry only
try:
    for log_entry in remote.log(limit=1):
        print(log_entry.author)
except SvnException:
    # Handle
    pass
```

### `svn info`

Provides a named tuple with the info returned by the `svn info` subcommand. Fields are:
"url", "relative_url", "entry_kind", "entry_path", "entry_revision", "repository_root", "repository_uuid", 
"wcinfo_wcroot_abspath", "wcinfo_schedule", "wcinfo_depth", "commit_author", "commit_date", "commit_revision".

```python
try:
    info = remote.info()
    print(info.repository_root)
except SvnException:
    # Handle
    pass
```

### `svn list`

Yields the contents only of the remote repository root directory.

```python
try:
    for root_content in remote.list():
        print(root_content)
except SvnException:
    # Handle
    pass

# Prints, e.g.:
# 
# trunk/
# branches/
# tags/
```
