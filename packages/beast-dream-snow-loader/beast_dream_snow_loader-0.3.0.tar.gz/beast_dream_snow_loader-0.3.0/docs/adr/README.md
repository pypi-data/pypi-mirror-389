# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for this project.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs document important architectural decisions, their context, rationale, and consequences. They help future developers understand why certain decisions were made.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status** - Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Date** - When the decision was made
- **Deciders** - Who made the decision
- **Context** - The situation and problem statement
- **Decision** - The chosen solution with rationale
- **Consequences** - Positive and negative impacts
- **Implementation** - Where/how it's implemented
- **References** - Related documentation

## Current ADRs

- **[ADR-0001: ServiceNow CI Class Selection](0001-servicenow-ci-class-selection.md)** - Decision on which ServiceNow CMDB classes to use for UniFi Dream Machine entities
