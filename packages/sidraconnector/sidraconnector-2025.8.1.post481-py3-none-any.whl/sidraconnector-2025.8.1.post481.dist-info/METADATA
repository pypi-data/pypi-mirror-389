# Introduction 
This project contains the Python SDK for Connectors. 

This SDK contains methods intended to use from Jupyter notebooks as part of Sidra Connectors. Most methods will require SidraApiPythonClient and could be implemented using SidraApiPythonClient only, but the SDK implementation will be more friendly and easy to use
