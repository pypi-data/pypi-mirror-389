"""Typer Manifest - Introspect Typer apps and export their command structure.

This package provides a pluggable system for collecting CLI structure information
and rendering it in various formats.

New API (recommended):
    - collect_manifest: Introspect CLI apps and return manifest dict
    - render_manifest: Render manifest with pluggable renderers
    - JsonRenderer, MarkdownRenderer, CompactMarkdownRenderer: Built-in renderers
    - Renderer: Protocol for custom renderers

Legacy API (backward compatibility):
    - build_manifest: Alias for collect_manifest
    - write_manifest: Collect and write as JSON file
    - render_manifest_list: Render as Markdown (delegates to MarkdownRenderer)
