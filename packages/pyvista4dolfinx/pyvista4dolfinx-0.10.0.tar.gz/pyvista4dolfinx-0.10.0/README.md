Re-introduction of a simple `plot` function for [Dolfinx](https://www.fenicsproject.org/). Documentation can be found [here](https://fenicsx4flow.gitlab.io/pyvista4dolfinx).

## Description

FEniCSx' design principles prioritize parallel efficiency, and (in an effort to avoid opaque performance pitfalls) favor fine-grained control over a high-level interface. Consequently, simple, general-purpose plotting routines are no-longer in the standard library. Instead users are deferred to ``pyvista`` for their plotting needs. Unfortunately, quite a bit of boiler-plate code is required to interface ``dolfinx`` and ``pyvista``. At a prototyping stage one often desires quick-and-dirty visualization with a *simple* interface. To facilitate this, ``pyvista4dolfinx`` provides a single ``plot`` function that can be used to plot most of ``dolfinx`` visualizable data-structures; scalar- and vector-valued ``Function``, ``Mesh``, ``FacetMarker``, and even integration ``Measure``. The function returns a ``pyvista.Plotter`` instance, such that the user still has full access to ``pyvista``'s full range of capabilities.

## Installation

This library is available through PyPi, to install simply run the following commands:

```bash
pip install pyvista4dolfinx
```

Although you might have to be mindfull of the version. `pyvista4dolfinx` maintains the same version numbering as `dolfinx`. So, if you're not using the latest `dolfinx` release, you might have to install a particular tagged version:

```bash
pip install pyvista4dolfinx==0.9.2
```

## Contributing
Feel free to make requests through opening an `issue`, or, better yet, if you want to contribute directly:

1. Fork the project.
2. Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/my-feature).
3. Add your new feature or bugfix.
4. Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add some feature').
5. Push to the branch (git push origin feature/my-feature).
6. Open a merge request.

## To publish:

1. Bump version number in pyproject toml
2. If dolfinx version change, then also update gitlab-ci image and push updated docker image to hub.
3. Push
4. Create git tag (`git tag <new_tag>`)
5. Push tag (`git push origin --tags`)
