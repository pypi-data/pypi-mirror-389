# 🧠 Brainet

**Never lose your train of thought again.**

Brainet is an AI-powered development context tracker that automatically captures what you're working on, why you're working on it, and what's next. Think of it as a second brain for your coding sessions.

## 🤔 The Problem

You're deep in the zone, building a feature. Then...
- 📧 An urgent email arrives
- 🔥 A production bug needs fixing  
- ☕ You take a break
- 📅 It's Friday, you'll continue Monday

**Monday morning:** *"Wait... what was I doing? Why did I change this file? What was the plan?"*

You spend 30 minutes scrolling through git commits, reading code, trying to remember. Your flow state? Gone.

## ✨ The Solution

Brainet captures your coding sessions automatically and uses AI to create human-readable summaries:

```bash
$ brainet capture

📸 Context Captured
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Added a Character class with methods for combat (attack, 
take_damage, heal), progression (gain_experience, level_up), 
and status checking (is_alive). Also added Inventory class 
with item management.

📊 Stats:
   • 1 files modified
   • 67 lines added
   • 3 TODOs found

✓ Capsule saved: 2025-11-02 15:45:53
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Now when you come back, just run `brainet history` and instantly remember everything.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Install brainet
pip install brainet --user

# 2. Add to PATH permanently
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Check it works
brainet --version

# 2. Get free API key from https://console.groq.com/keys

# 3. Set it permanently
echo 'export GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_your_key_here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# 4. Start using brainet in any git project!
cd your-project

brainet start
# ... make some changes ...
brainet capture --tag feature -m "Added user authentication"
```

That's it! Brainet is now tracking your development context.

## 💡 Key Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Summaries
Brainet uses Claude Sonnet 3.5 (via Groq) to understand your changes and generate intelligent summaries. It knows the difference between:
- Major features vs minor refactors
- Bug fixes vs new functionality  
- Breaking changes vs safe updates

### 🔍 Natural Language Querying (Powered by 5 Sources)
Ask questions about your work in plain English - now with comprehensive context:

```bash
$ brainet ask "what methods does the Character class have?"

You have a Character class with these methods: __init__ 
(lines 4-10), take_damage (lines 12-15), heal (lines 17-20), 
is_alive (lines 22-23), attack (lines 25-27), gain_experience 
(lines 29-32), and level_up (lines 34-39). The TODOs include 
adding a magic system with spells, implementing quest tracking, 
and adding save/load game functionality.
```

**v0.2.0 Intelligence:** Brainet now searches through full file contents, AST structure, and semantically related code to give you accurate, detailed answers with line numbers.

### 🏢 Multi-Project Support
Working on multiple projects? Brainet handles it seamlessly:

```bash
$ brainet workspaces

📚 Active Brainet Sessions (3):
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Project      ┃ Location               ┃ Capsules ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━┩
│ api-backend  │ ~/projects/api         │       12 │
│ frontend-app │ ~/projects/frontend    │        8 │
│ mobile-app   │ ~/projects/mobile      │        5 │
└──────────────┴────────────────────────┴──────────┘
```

> **📍 Note:** The `workspaces` command scans these directories for brainet projects:
> - `~/Desktop` - For desktop projects
> - `~/Documents` - For document-based work
> - `~/Projects` - For dedicated project folders
> 
> Keep your projects in these locations for automatic discovery!

### 🔎 Cross-Project Search
Find where you implemented that feature across all your projects:

```bash
$ brainet search "authentication" --all-projects

🔍 Found in 3 projects:
  • api-backend: JWT authentication with refresh tokens
  • frontend-app: Google OAuth integration
  • mobile-app: Biometric authentication added
```

### 📊 Development Analytics
Understand your coding patterns:

```bash
$ brainet stats

📊 Development Insights
────────────────────────────────────────
  Sessions: 47
  Files modified: 234
  Most active file: auth.py (23 changes)
  Top tags: feature, bugfix, refactor
  
  Recent activity:
  • 15 sessions this week
  • Peak productivity: Tuesday afternoons
────────────────────────────────────────
```

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **Context Switching**
Switch between tasks without losing context:
```bash
# Working on Feature A
brainet capture --tag feature-a

# Emergency bug fix needed
brainet pause
cd ~/other-project
brainet start
# Fix bug...
brainet capture --tag hotfix

# Back to Feature A
cd ~/original-project
brainet resume  # Instantly recall where you left off
```

### 2. **Code Reviews**
Generate PR descriptions automatically:
```bash
brainet export --since yesterday

# Copy the AI-generated summary into your PR
```

### 3. **Weekly Standups**
"What did I work on this week?"
```bash
brainet history --since "1 week ago"

# See all your accomplishments summarized
```

### 4. **Knowledge Transfer**
Onboarding a teammate:
```bash
brainet export --tag authentication > auth_work.md

# Share the complete history of authentication feature
```

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **File Watching** - Tracks changes in your git repository
2. **Git Integration** - Captures commits, diffs, and file changes
3. **TODO Extraction** - Finds TODO comments automatically
4. **AI Analysis** - Claude Sonnet 3.5 generates intelligent summaries
5. **Local Storage** - Everything saved locally in `.brainet/` folder

**Privacy First:** All your data stays on your machine. AI summaries are generated via API but your code never leaves your control.

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### API Keys

Brainet supports two AI providers:

**Groq (Recommended)** - Free, fast, 500+ tokens/sec
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

**Anthropic Claude** - More powerful, requires paid account
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Capture with custom tags
brainet capture --tag feature --tag auth -m "Added JWT support"

# Export filtered sessions
brainet export --tag bugfix --since "2024-10-01"

# Search in current project only
brainet search "payment integration"

# Clean up old sessions
brainet cleanup --days 90
```

---

## 🎓 Best Practices

1. **Capture Often** - At least once per coding session
2. **Use Tags** - Organize with `--tag feature`, `--tag bugfix`, etc.
3. **Add Messages** - Use `-m` for important context
4. **Regular Cleanup** - Run `brainet cleanup` monthly
5. **Export Important Work** - Save milestones to Markdown
6. **Organize Projects** - Keep projects in `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents`, or `~/Projects` for the `workspaces` command to find them automatically
