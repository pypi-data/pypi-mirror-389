# 🛰️ GitPulse CLI

> Track every git pull across your repositories — automatically.

GitPulse is a lightweight Python CLI that silently tracks `git pull` events and reports them to a GitPulse dashboard (Laravel-based). It's designed for teams, freelancers, and open-source maintainers who want to know **who pulled what, and when** — without any friction.

---

## 🚀 Part 1: For Regular Users

If you just want to use GitPulse with the official dashboard (hosted by the GitPulse team), follow these simple steps 👇

### 🧩 Installation

Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed, then run:

```bash
pip install gitpulse-cli
```

Once installed, confirm it works:

```bash
gitpulse --version
```

---

### ⚙️ Setup Inside a Git Project

Navigate into any of your Git repositories and run:

```bash
gitpulse setup
```

**That's it ✅**  
This will automatically install a Git hook that runs after every `git pull`.

If you ever want to reinstall the hook cleanly:

```bash
gitpulse setup --force
```

---

### 📡 How It Works

Every time you or anyone in your team runs:

```bash
git pull
```

GitPulse automatically sends a lightweight event to the GitPulse API, containing:

- ✅ Repository name
- ✅ Current branch
- ✅ Git user email
- ✅ UTC timestamp

Your Laravel-powered dashboard will instantly update with who pulled the latest changes and when.

---

### 🖥️ View Pull Activity

Log into the **GitPulse Dashboard**:

👉 **[https://gitpulse.io](https://gitpulse.io)**

You'll see your repositories, branches, and last pull timestamps beautifully displayed.

---

### 🧹 Uninstall

If you ever want to remove the GitPulse hook from a project:

```bash
rm .git/hooks/post-merge
```

---

## 🧠 Part 2: For Developers / Self-Hosting

If you're a developer who wants to run your own private GitPulse server (e.g., for enterprise or intranet use), you can easily clone and customize both components.

### 1️⃣ Clone the CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gitpulse-cli.git
cd gitpulse-cli
pip install -e .
```

This installs it locally in **"editable" mode** so you can modify the source.

---

### 2️⃣ Set Your Own API Endpoint

Edit `gitpulse/main.py` and update the API URL:

```python
API_URL = "https://your-private-domain.com/api/report-pull"
```

Now your CLI will send pull events to your private backend instead of the public GitPulse server.

---

### 3️⃣ Deploy the Laravel Backend

You can either fork or deploy the official GitPulse backend (Laravel app).

**Features include:**

- REST API endpoint (`/api/report-pull`)
- Admin dashboard with real-time pull activity
- User authentication & access control
- Per-repo and per-user activity logs

**Setup is as simple as:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gitpulse-laravel.git
composer install
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

Then update your CLI's `API_URL` to point to this new backend.

---

### 4️⃣ Optional: Publish Your Forked CLI

You can publish your modified version to your private PyPI server:

```bash
python -m build
twine upload --repository-url https://your-pypi-server.com dist/*
```

---

## 🧩 Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Developer clones a repo
git clone https://github.com/org/project.git

# 2. Installs GitPulse hook once
gitpulse setup

# 3. Pulls latest updates
git pull

# 4. Event automatically sent
✅ Git pull event reported successfully!
```

Dashboard updates automatically 🎉
