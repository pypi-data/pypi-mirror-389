# Hidden Regime MCP Server

**Model Context Protocol server for HMM-based market regime detection**

Enable AI assistants like Claude to detect and analyze market regimes using Hidden Markov Models directly in natural language conversations.

---

## What is This?

The Hidden Regime MCP server exposes regime detection capabilities to AI assistants via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Once configured, you can ask Claude questions like:

- "What's SPY's current market regime?"
- "Analyze NVDA's regime statistics for 2024"
- "What's the probability QQQ transitions to a bear regime?"

Claude will automatically call the Hidden Regime tools and provide analysis based on HMM regime detection.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment
source ~/hidden-regime-pyenv/bin/activate

# Install with MCP extras
pip install hidden-regime[mcp]
```

### 2. Configure Claude Desktop

The model detects this as a bearish regime, indicating transition from the strong uptrend that characterized earlier performance. This is typical consolidation or correction after a major rally."
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Temporal Awareness**: Understand how long the regime has persisted and when it might change
- **Price Context**: See how the regime relates to actual price performance (YTD, 30d, 7d)
- **Smart Interpretation**: Explanations that reconcile seemingly contradictory signals (e.g., "bearish" regime despite YTD gains)
- **Stability Analysis**: Know if regimes are stable or frequently changing

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Quick Market Check with Context

**You:**
```
What's the current market regime for SPY and QQQ?
```

**Claude:**
```
Let me check the current regimes for both tickers.

[Calls detect_regime for SPY and QQQ]

SPY: Bearish regime (94% confidence)
- Has been in this regime for 63 days (89.6% of expected duration)
- Regime status: mature
- YTD performance: +17.7%
- 30-day performance: +2.0%
- Stability: stable (0 transitions in last 30 days)
- Interpretation: "High volatility phase with modest positive returns"

While SPY is up significantly YTD, the current regime reflects increased
volatility (8.4% daily) indicating consolidation after the strong rally.
This is a mature regime approaching expected transition.

QQQ: Similar pattern with bull regime characteristics and positive YTD returns.

Both indices show stable regimes but approaching potential transition points.
Monitor for regime changes as signals for strategy adjustments.
```

### Scenario 2: Historical Analysis

**You:**
```
Analyze NVDA's regime behavior during 2024. Were there significant regime changes?
```

**Claude:**
```
Let me analyze NVDA's regimes throughout 2024.

[Calls get_regime_statistics with start_date="2024-01-01", end_date="2024-12-31"]

NVDA showed 3 distinct regimes in 2024:

Bull Regime (68% of year):
- Mean return: +3.2%
- Average duration: 45 days
- Win rate: 72%

Sideways Regime (22%):
- Mean return: -0.3%
- Average duration: 12 days

Bear Regime (10%):
- Mean return: -2.8%
- Average duration: 8 days

Notable: NVDA spent most of 2024 in bull regime, with brief
sideways consolidations. Bear regime appearances were short-lived.
```

### Scenario 3: Risk Assessment

**You:**
```
I'm holding SPY in a bull regime. What's the risk it transitions to bear?
```

**Claude:**
```
[Calls get_transition_probabilities for SPY]

Based on SPY's historical transition patterns:

Current: Bull regime

Transition probabilities:
- Stay in bull: 85%
- Move to sideways: 10%
- Move to bear: 5%

Expected bull regime duration: ~20 days

Analysis: Direct bull → bear transitions are rare (5%). More
common path is bull → sideways → bear. Current risk is low,
but watch for sideways regime as early warning signal.
```

### Scenario 4: Understanding Regime vs. Price Action

**You:**
```
NVDA is at a YTD high but you're saying it's in a bearish regime? That doesn't make sense.
```

**Claude:**
```
[Calls detect_regime for NVDA]

Great question! Let me explain what's happening with NVDA:

Current Status:
- Regime: Bearish (89% confidence)
- YTD Return: +46.4%
- 30-day Return: +8.1%
- Current Price: $202.49 (up trend)

Explanation:
The bearish regime doesn't mean NVDA is down - it's actually up significantly!
The regime reflects the *statistical characteristics* of recent price behavior:

- High volatility: 21.4% daily (very elevated)
- Just transitioned from bullish regime (2 days ago)
- This is typical consolidation after a major rally

Think of it as: "The strong uptrend has paused, and we're now in a high-volatility
consolidation phase." The HMM detects the change in behavior patterns, not just
price direction.

This is actually useful for risk management - the regime tells you that despite
the YTD gains, recent volatility is elevated and behavior is different from the
strong trending phase that drove earlier returns.
```

### Scenario 5: Strategy Selection

**You:**
```
I'm trading QQQ today. Should I use trend-following or mean-reversion?
```

**Claude:**
```
[Calls detect_regime for QQQ]

QQQ is currently in a bull regime (78% confidence):
- Mean return: +2.8%
- Volatility: 14%
- Regime status: mid (45% complete)
- Days in regime: 23 of expected 51 days
- Stability: stable

Recommendation: Trend-following

Bull regimes favor directional strategies:
- Moving average crossovers
- Breakout systems
- Trailing stops

This regime is still in mid-phase with good stability (no recent transitions),
suggesting the trend has room to run. Avoid mean-reversion in bull regimes -
prices tend to trend rather than revert.

Consider re-evaluating when regime approaches "mature" status or shows signs
of transition to sideways.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Appearing

**Symptoms:** Claude doesn't show Hidden Regime tools

**Solutions:**
1. Check JSON syntax in config file (use JSONLint)
2. Verify Python path: `which python` in terminal
3. Verify server.py path exists
4. Check Claude Desktop logs (Help → View Logs)
5. Completely quit Claude (Cmd+Q), don't just close window

### Tools Not Working

**Symptoms:** Tools appear but return errors

**Solutions:**
1. Check hidden-regime package is installed: `pip show hidden-regime`
2. Install MCP extras: `pip install hidden-regime[mcp]`
3. Test server manually: `fastmcp run /path/to/server.py`
4. Check for firewall/permission issues

### Slow Responses

**Symptoms:** Tools take >10 seconds to respond

**Solutions:**
1. First query typically takes 2-5 seconds to fetch data and train HMM model
2. Check internet connection (yfinance needs data access)
3. Try shorter date ranges
4. Use fewer states (n_states=2 is faster than 5)

### Import Errors

**Symptoms:** "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastmcp'"

**Solutions:**
1. Install MCP extras: `pip install hidden-regime[mcp]`
2. Verify correct virtual environment is activated
3. Check pip installation: `pip list | grep fastmcp`

### Data Loading Errors

**Symptoms:** "Unable to load data for TICKER"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify ticker symbol is correct (use Yahoo Finance symbol)
2. Check internet connection
3. Try different ticker (some have limited data)
4. Avoid weekends/holidays (markets closed)

### Common Error Messages

**Error:** `"Unable to load data for TICKER. Please check the ticker symbol and try again."`
- **Cause:** Invalid ticker symbol or no data available from Yahoo Finance
- **Solution:** Verify ticker exists on Yahoo Finance, check spelling, try a different ticker

**Error:** `"Insufficient data for TICKER. Need at least 100 observations for reliable regime detection."`
- **Cause:** Ticker has too few trading days (e.g., recently IPO'd stocks, delisted stocks)
- **Solution:** Use a longer date range or choose a ticker with more history

**Error:** `"No data available for TICKER in the specified date range. This may be due to weekends, holidays, or insufficient trading data."`
- **Cause:** Date range contains no trading days (weekends/holidays) or empty DataFrame
- **Solution:** Use a date range that includes trading days, avoid single-day queries on weekends

**Error:** `"start_date must be before or equal to end_date"`
- **Cause:** Invalid date range (start date is after end date)
- **Solution:** Check date parameters, ensure start_date < end_date

**Error:** `"end_date cannot be in the future"`
- **Cause:** Trying to analyze future dates
- **Solution:** Use current or past dates only

**Error:** `"n_states must be between 2 and 5"`
- **Cause:** Invalid number of regimes specified
- **Solution:** Use n_states value between 2 and 5 (3 is recommended default)

**Error:** `"Ticker symbol is required"`
- **Cause:** Empty or missing ticker parameter
- **Solution:** Provide a valid ticker symbol

**Error:** `"Ticker symbol too long: TICKER. Max 10 characters"`
- **Cause:** Ticker exceeds maximum length
- **Solution:** Use standard ticker symbols (typically 1-5 characters)

## Performance Tips

### Query Performance

Each query requires fetching data from Yahoo Finance and training an HMM model, which takes 2-5 seconds.

**Factors affecting speed:**
- **Ticker popularity**: Major indices (SPY, QQQ) have reliable data and load quickly
- **Date range**: Longer date ranges require more data processing
- **Number of states**: More states (n_states=4 or 5) require more complex model training

### Optimal Usage

**Faster queries:**
```
"What's SPY's current regime?"
- Default parameters (n_states=3)
- Major ticker with reliable data
- Recent date range (default)
```

**Slower queries:**
```
"Analyze regime for OBSCURETICKER with 5 states from 2000-2024"
- Obscure ticker (may have missing data)
- 24-year date range
- 5 states (more complex model)
```

**Recommendation:** Use default parameters (n_states=3) for best balance of speed and insight.

## Limitations & Constraints

### Data Requirements

**Minimum Observations:**
- Regime detection requires at least **100 trading days** of data
- Fewer observations will result in "Insufficient data" error
- Recommendation: Use tickers with at least 6 months of trading history

**Data Source:**
- All data comes from Yahoo Finance via the `yfinance` library
- Data quality and availability depend on Yahoo Finance
- Some tickers may have gaps, missing data, or be delisted

### Temporal Constraints

**Market Hours:**
- No data available on weekends, holidays, or non-trading days
- Queries on weekends/holidays will return "No data available" error
- Use date ranges that include actual trading days

**Data Frequency:**
- Only **daily** data is supported (close prices or OHLC average)
- No intraday regime detection (1-min, 5-min, hourly, etc.)
- Historical data only - cannot analyze real-time tick data

**Date Ranges:**
- Future dates are not allowed
- `start_date` must be before or equal to `end_date`
- Very long date ranges (>10 years) may be slow

### Model Constraints

**Number of Regimes:**
- Must specify between 2 and 5 states (`n_states`)
- Default is 3 (typically: bull, bear, sideways)
- More states require more data for reliable estimation

**Model Assumptions:**
- Assumes Gaussian emission distributions (may underestimate tail risk)
- Point estimates only - no uncertainty quantification
- Batch processing - no online/incremental learning

### Performance Constraints

**Query Speed:**
- Each query takes 2-5 seconds (data fetch + HMM training)
- No caching - every query recomputes from scratch
- Longer date ranges and more states are slower

**Rate Limits:**
- Subject to Yahoo Finance rate limits
- Too many rapid queries may trigger temporary blocking
- Recommendation: Space out queries if analyzing many tickers

### System Constraints

**Local Execution:**
- MCP server runs on your local machine (not cloud-hosted)
- Requires active internet connection for Yahoo Finance data
- Claude Desktop must be running for MCP to work

**Platform Support:**
- Tested on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL)
- Requires Python 3.9+ environment
- Requires `hidden-regime` package with MCP extras installed

## FAQ

### Q: Does this send my data to a server?

**A:** No. The MCP server runs entirely on your local machine. Your queries and regime detection results never leave your computer.

### Q: Do I need an API key?

**A:** No. The server uses yfinance which is free and doesn't require API keys.

### Q: Can I use this with other AI assistants?

**A:** Yes, any MCP-compatible client works (Claude Desktop, VS Code with MCP extension, custom applications).

### Q: How accurate is the regime detection?

**A:** Regime detection is probabilistic. Confidence scores indicate certainty. High confidence (>80%) suggests strong regime signal. Low confidence (<50%) suggests uncertain/transitional period.

### Q: Can I analyze multiple tickers at once?

**A:** Yes, ask Claude to analyze multiple tickers and it will call the tool multiple times in parallel.

### Q: What data source does it use?

**A:** Yahoo Finance via the yfinance library. Same data source as the core Hidden Regime package.

### Q: How far back can I analyze?

**A:** Depends on ticker. Most major indices (SPY, QQQ) have data back to 1990s. Individual stocks vary.

### Q: Can I analyze intraday regimes?

**A:** No, currently only daily data is supported.
