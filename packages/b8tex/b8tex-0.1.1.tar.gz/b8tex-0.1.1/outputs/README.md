# Outputs Directory

This directory contains example PDF outputs generated by b8tex.

## Purpose

The `outputs/` directory serves as a demonstration and testing space for:
- Example PDF files generated from LaTeX templates
- Sample outputs showing b8tex capabilities
- Test results from integration tests
- Quick reference examples for users

## Git Ignore

This directory is **git-ignored** to prevent binary PDF files from being committed to version control. Only this README file is tracked.

## Expected Contents

Files that should appear in this directory include:
- `example.pdf` - Basic example output
- `article_*.pdf` - Article template outputs
- `report_*.pdf` - Report template outputs
- `presentation_*.pdf` - Presentation/beamer outputs
- `custom_*.pdf` - Custom template examples
- Any other PDF files generated during development or testing

## Usage

To generate example outputs:
```bash
# Run examples from the examples directory
python examples/basic_usage.py
python examples/watch_mode.py

# Or use the CLI directly
pytex examples/templates/simple.tex --output outputs/example.pdf
```

## Note

PDF files in this directory are automatically cleaned up and regenerated as needed. Do not commit PDF files from this directory to the repository.
