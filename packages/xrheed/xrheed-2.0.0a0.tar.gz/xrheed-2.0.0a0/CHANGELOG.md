# Changelog

<a name="2.0.0"></a>
## [2.0.0] – 2025-xx-xx

### Added
- Added `file_name` and `file_creation_time` attributes to loaded images.  
- Added new example images for the 3D stacking notebook.  
- Added support for image stacks with `alpha` coordinates in `conversion.image.transform_image_to_kxky`.  
- Added full support for stack images in `kinematics.Ewald`.  
- Introduced `enable_logging()` utility for easier logging configuration.  

### Changed
- Refactored and simplified the data loading logic for maintainability.  
- Refactored RI accessors to work with both 2D and 3D (stacked) images.  
- Improved profile plotting and representation to support reduction along `sx`, `sy`, and other dimensions (including 3D stacks).  
- Updated ARHEED `kx–ky` transformation visuals with new example images.  
- Updated documentation for advanced `kx–ky` transformations using multiple (stack) images.  
 - Standardized logging across core modules (module-level loggers, lazy-style messages) to improve diagnostics.
 - Added documentation on logging usage and configuration (`docs/source/logging.rst`).
 - Updated `preparation` module especially functions used to center the RHEED image.

### Removed
- **Breaking:** Removed `load_data_manual()`. The unified `load_data()` now handles both automatic and manual loading (manual mode applies when no plugin is provided).
- **Breaking:** Removed from `ri` accessors `apply_image_center()`  

### Renamed
- **Breaking:** Renamed `ewald_sphere_radius` → `ewald_radius` in RI accessors for naming consistency.
- **Breaking:** Replaced symbolic angle names `beta` and `alpha` with descriptive `incident_angle` and `azimuthal_angle` in xrheed API (aliases preserved).

### Split
- **Breaking:** Replaced `apply_image_center()` with two clearer functions: `set_center_manual()` and `set_center_auto()`.

- Expose `load_data` and `load_data_manual` at the package root (`xrheed.load_data`) for simpler imports
- Update documentation and examples to reflect the new recommended loading approach
- Adopt setuptools_scm for dynamic versioning from git tags

<a name="1.1.2"></a>
## [1.1.2] – 2025-09-19

- Minor fixes in example notebooks
- Update citation

<a name="1.1.1"></a>
## [1.1.1] – 2025-09-15

- **Add** `load_data_manual()` to load RHEED images when no plugin is available.
- **Refactor** `io.py` → `loaders.py`  
  - Breaking change: code using `from xrheed.io import ...` must now use `from xrheed.loaders import ...`  
  - Resolves the naming conflict with Python's standard library `io` and clarifies the module’s purpose (data loading only).

- **Documentation fixes and updates:**  
  - Updated example notebook sections.  
  - Updated badges.
  - Updated plugin and xarray_accessors references in the API documentation.
