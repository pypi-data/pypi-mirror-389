    "# Ewald Spot Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of the `Ewald` class methods from the `kinematics` module to determine either the surface reconstruction orientation or the lattice constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the surface exhibits a well-defined and visible (1×1) structure, which may be used for image scaling. Alternatively, the image may be calibrated and aligned using external reference data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we construct a lattice object representing, for example, a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice with unknown azimuthal orientation and lattice constant. This scenario is typical for complex surface reconstructions such as (√7 × √7) R19.1°, which often produce intricate RHEED (Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction) patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common situation arises when the RHEED image is acquired along a non-symmetric crystallographic direction, often due to experimental constraints (e.g., lack of azimuthal rotation). In such cases, the diffraction pattern may be difficult to interpret, complicating the analysis of surface reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the supported functionality includes the following scenarios:\n",
    "- **(I)** Determination of the azimuthal orientation of a predefined lattice (hexagonal or rectangular) with fixed lattice vectors — `match_alpha()` method.\n",
    "- **(II)** Scaling analysis of a hexagonal or rectangular lattice with a fixed azimuthal orientation — `match_scale()` method.\n",
    "- **(III)** Simultaneous determination of both scaling and azimuthal orientation for hexagonal or rectangular lattices, assuming a fixed ratio between lattice vectors — `match_alpha_scale()` method.\n"

    "## Algorithm Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of the algorithm implemented here is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the lattice structure expected to occur on the sample surface.\n",
    "2. Overlay the lattice onto the experimental RHEED image.\n",
    "3. Generate a mask composed of elliptical spots, positioned according to the calculated diffraction spot locations derived from Ewald sphere construction.\n",
    "4. Integrate the pixel intensities within the masked regions to compute a single scalar value—referred to as the `matching_coefficient`. This coefficient quantifies the agreement between the expected lattice and the experimental RHEED pattern. A higher value indicates better correspondence.\n",
    "5. Systematically rotate or scale the lattice and repeat the above steps to evaluate the `matching_coefficient` across different configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By scanning over a range of possible scaling factors and orientations, the configuration yielding the highest `matching_coefficient` serves as a strong candidate for the actual lattice present on the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cache Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculations shown below can be time-consuming. In a 2D case, scanning a wide range of scaling factors and azimuthal angles with small step sizes may take several hours on an average computer to generate a complete matching map.\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize performance, the results are automatically serialized using `dill` and stored in the `cache` directory. Only one `.dill` file is saved per call to a specific `match_*` method. When these methods are invoked, they first check for an existing cache file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To force recalculation, either delete the corresponding cache file or set `Ewald.use_cache = False` for the specific `Ewald` object.\n"

    "\n",
    "The key features of interest in the matching map are located at the following coordinates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scale = 1.0, α = +15°** — Corresponds to the Si(111)-(1×1) lattice.\n",
    "- **Scale ≈ 1.7, α = −15°** — Matches the (√3 × √3) R30° surface reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: The matching map contains several sharp features, some of which are artifacts caused by occasional overlap between calculated spot positions and intense regions in the RHEED image. These artifacts can produce misleading peaks and should be interpreted with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there is a broader and less intense peak at **Scale = 2.0, α = +15°**. This feature originates from a (1×1) lattice scaled by a factor of 2, where every second calculated spot coincidentally aligns with bright regions in the experimental image.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this produces a noticeable peak in the matching coefficient, it likely reflects an algorithm artifact rather than a true physical reconstruction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such cases underscore the importance of combining matching analysis with physical intuition and known surface symmetries.\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis successfully identifies both the Si(111)-(1×1) structure and the Si(111)-(√3 × √3) R30° surface reconstruction. The matching map reveals distinct peaks corresponding to these configurations, confirming their presence in the experimental RHEED image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the sample appears to be rotated by approximately +15° relative to the high-symmetry [11-2] crystallographic direction, consistent with the observed azimuthal offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visually confirm these findings, we now plot the two reconstructed lattices over the RHEED image using their respective rotation angles. This final step provides a direct comparison between calculated spot positions and experimental diffraction features, validating the accuracy of the matching procedure.\n"
