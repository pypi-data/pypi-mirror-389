Experimental package with some functions I found useful for automating frequently used tasks

The package is for illustration only - it is unlikely it will be updated. Or it may be replaced by a more comprehensive list of other packages.

It has the following functions: 
- read_named_range_to_dataframe(file_path, sheet_name, range_name, header=True)
    - reads data to a python dataframe from a named range in excel. 
    - arguments are: 
        - filepath: the name of the file, together with the path, if not in the working directory
        - sheet_name: self-explanatory
        - range_name: self-explanatory
        - header: defaults to True, which assumes the table/range has a label.
    - even if you put "A1:B5", the code should work. ,m,
    - it reads single cells as well as rectangular ranges.
    - It probably fails with ranges that are neither of the two above. 
    - it works with .xlsx and .xlsm files. Does not work with .xlsb files for now. 

-   forward_rate(rfr, t1,t2, comp="ann")
    - calculates the forward rate between two times
    - takes as inputs a list of spot rates and the two times between which the forward rate is to be calculated
    - the list is assumed to have rates at each year (so it assumes annual rates)
    - by default it assumes annual compounding. You can set comp = "cont" for continuous formula.

-   send2clipboard(A,colnames = ["datafrompython"])
    - used mainly while debugging jupyter notebook files; 
    - A is usually a numpy array. 
    - you can add a colnames argument that matches the number of columns of the array
    - no index is printed.

-   print_stats(myseries,percentiles = [0.01, 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95, 0.99], colnames = None)
    - prints various statistics from the myseries data; the built-in describe function didnt do it for me!
    - myseries needs to be a numpy array with numerical data only; nan values will result in error
    - as well as the percentiles, it prints mean, st.dev, skewness, kurtosis, min and max
    - colnames need to have the right size, or it will result in an error. or you can leave empty
    - this is a crude stats function. a more sophisticated one will be published in due course.

-  align_to_schema(subdf: pd.DataFrame, maindf: pd.DataFrame)
    - produces a single dataframe with all columns of the main dataframe, maintaining their order.
    - it also adds any columns in the subdf that are not in the maindf 
    - it makes sure there is no NaN data, by putting zeros or empty strings in the relevant columns
    - useful for combining a "base position" list of assets with a "buy list" which may have some fields that are not relevant in the base scenario (e.g. asset base MA or asset base FS)

If you have used the previous version, please note the forward rate calc was wrong - it is fixed now.
