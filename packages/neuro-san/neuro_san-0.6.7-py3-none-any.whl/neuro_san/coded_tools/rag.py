    A CodedTool implementation that performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    using URLs obtained from a website search.

    This class assumes that a prior search has been conducted to identify relevant URLs.
    It then retrieves the content from those URLs and applies a language model to
    generate responses based on the retrieved information.

    This is useful in workflows where external search tools provide candidate links,
    and RAG is applied afterward to synthesize a meaningful answer from the linked content.
