# 🌦️ hybmkg-pycast

hybmkg-pycast is a hybrid machine learning and deep learning framework for climate and weather forecasting.
It is designed to integrate multiple forecasting approaches — from classical statistical models to modern deep learning architectures — and support research and operational applications at BMKG (Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency of Indonesia).

# 🚀 Key Features

### Comprehensive Forecasting Models

Statistical: ARIMA, SARIMA, ANFIS, Wavelet-ARIMA, Wavelet-ANFIS, etc.

Machine Learning: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, SVR, KNN, MLP using multi-stacked approach.

Deep Learning: RNN, LSTM, GRU, CNN, Transformer, and hybrid approaches using multi-stacked approach.

### Flexible Data Input

Supports both NetCDF and CSV formats for climate and environmental datasets.

### Hybrid Framework

Combine traditional time series models with machine learning and deep learning methods for improved forecast accuracy.

### Visualization and Evaluation

Built-in utilities for plotting time series, model diagnostics, and forecast verification (correlation, RMSE, R²).
