# Release Management

## Release Strategy

Ariadne follows a **predictable, quality-focused release strategy** — every release is deterministic, well-tested, and thoroughly documented.

## Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) with the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes, major architectural updates
- **MINOR** (1.X.0): New features, backend additions, performance improvements
- **PATCH** (1.1.X): Bug fixes, security updates, documentation improvements

### Pre-release Versions
- **Alpha** (1.2.0-alpha.1): Early development, major features incomplete
- **Beta** (1.2.0-beta.1): Feature complete, testing phase
- **Release Candidate** (1.2.0-rc.1): Final testing before stable release

## Release Schedule

### Regular Release Cycle
- **Major Releases**: Every 6-12 months
- **Minor Releases**: Every 6-8 weeks
- **Patch Releases**: As needed (security/critical bugs)
- **Security Releases**: Within 48 hours of confirmed vulnerability

### Special Releases
- **LTS (Long Term Support)**: Every 18 months, supported for 2 years
- **Hardware Support**: Aligned with major platform releases (new Apple Silicon, CUDA versions)
- **Backend Integration**: When major quantum computing frameworks release

## Release Process

### 1. Planning Phase (2-3 weeks before release)

**Release Manager Assignment**
- Core maintainer designated as release manager
- Responsible for coordinating entire release process
- Creates release tracking issue with checklist

**Feature Freeze**
- All features for release must be merged
- No new features accepted after freeze date
- Focus shifts to bug fixes and stabilization

**Documentation Review**
- Update all documentation for new features
- Review and update API documentation
- Ensure examples work with new version
- Update benchmark results if applicable

### 2. Pre-Release Phase (1-2 weeks)

**Quality Assurance**

**Automated Readiness Checks**
```bash
make release-check VERSION=X.Y.Z
```
The checklist validates packaging metadata, changelog structure, and release documentation before the artifact build begins.

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
make test-all

# Performance regression testing
python benchmarks/run_all_benchmarks.py --baseline previous-version

# Cross-platform testing
make test-platforms  # Linux, macOS, Windows

# Backend compatibility testing
make test-backends   # All supported quantum backends
```

**Security Audit**
- Dependency vulnerability scan
- Static code analysis
- Security review of new features
- Update security documentation if needed

**Pre-release Publishing**
```bash
# Create pre-release
git tag 1.2.0-rc.1
python -m build
twine upload dist/* --repository testpypi

# Community testing period
# Announce on GitHub Discussions
# Request feedback from key users
```
