# Changelog
## [Unreleased]

## [0.14.0] - 2024-11-05

### Added

- New `haiku.rag-slim` package with minimal dependencies for users who want to install only what they need
- Evaluations package (`haiku.rag-evals`) for internal benchmarking and testing
- Improved search filtering performance by using pandas DataFrames for joins instead of SQL WHERE IN clauses

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Restructured project into UV workspace with three packages:
  - `haiku.rag-slim` - Core package with minimal dependencies
  - `haiku.rag` - Full package with all extras (recommended for most users)
  - `haiku.rag-evals` - Internal benchmarking and evaluation tools
- Migrated from `pydantic-ai` to `pydantic-ai-slim` with extras system
- Docling is now an optional dependency (install with `haiku.rag-slim[docling]`)
- Package metadata checks now use `haiku.rag-slim` (always present) instead of `haiku.rag`
- Docker image optimized: removed evaluations package, reducing installed packages from 307 to 259
- Improved vector search performance through optimized score normalization

### Fixed

- ImportError now properly raised when optional docling dependency is missing
