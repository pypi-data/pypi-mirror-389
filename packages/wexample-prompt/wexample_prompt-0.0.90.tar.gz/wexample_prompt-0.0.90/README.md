## Prompt IO Quickstart

### WithIoManager: owning or sharing the IoManager
- Any class that needs prompt output should inherit `WithIoManager`.
- Call `self.ensure_io_manager()` to lazily create or reuse an `IoManager`.
- To inherit a parent’s indentation/verbosity, call `self.set_parent_io_handler(parent)`; every context you create is automatically nested +1.
- If someone else instantiates the manager, call `self.use_io_manager(io)` to reuse it instead of creating a new instance.

### WithIoMethods: direct method proxies
- Mix in `WithIoMethods` when you want to call `self.log(...)`, `self.separator(...)`, etc., without reaching into `self.io`.
- The mixin delegates missing attribute lookups to the underlying `IoManager`, and it automatically injects `context=self.create_io_context()` so nested logging just works.

### Typical pattern
```python
from wexample_prompt.mixins.with_io_methods import WithIoMethods

class Worker(WithIoMethods):
    def __attrs_post_init__(self):
        self.ensure_io_manager()          # Owns an IoManager

    def run(self):
        self.log("top level message")     # via WithIoMethods

class Child(WithIoMethods):
    def __attrs_post_init__(self, parent):
        self.set_parent_io_handler(parent)  # reuse & indent

    def run(self):
        self.log("nested message")
```

The executor or parent decides whether to create a fresh manager or cascade an existing one; children only call `ensure_io_manager()` and never worry about the init order.

## Tests

This project uses `pytest` for testing and `pytest-cov` for code coverage analysis.

### Installation

First, install the required testing dependencies:
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip install pytest pytest-cov
```

### Basic Usage

Run all tests with coverage:
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --cov
```

### Common Commands
```bash
# Run tests with coverage for a specific module
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --cov=your_module

# Show which lines are not covered
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --cov=your_module --cov-report=term-missing

# Generate an HTML coverage report
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --cov=your_module --cov-report=html

# Combine terminal and HTML reports
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --cov=your_module --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file with coverage
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_file.py --cov=your_module --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Viewing HTML Reports

After generating an HTML report, open `htmlcov/index.html` in your browser to view detailed line-by-line coverage information.

### Coverage Threshold

To enforce a minimum coverage percentage:
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --cov=your_module --cov-fail-under=80
```

This will cause the test suite to fail if coverage drops below 80%.

## Code Quality & Typing

All the suite packages follow strict quality standards:

- **Type hints**: Full type coverage with mypy validation
- **Code formatting**: Enforced with black and isort
- **Linting**: Comprehensive checks with custom scripts and tools
- **Testing**: High test coverage requirements

These standards ensure reliability and maintainability across the suite.
