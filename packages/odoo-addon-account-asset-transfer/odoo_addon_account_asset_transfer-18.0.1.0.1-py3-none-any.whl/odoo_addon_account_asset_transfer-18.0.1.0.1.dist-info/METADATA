This module allow transferring assets under construction (AUC) to normal
assets.

AUC is Asset under construction where some assets are in construction
phase and cost needs to be captured for the time being. Once asset is
fully completed then cost would be transferred to final asset

**Note:**

- If the asset don't have journal entries, asset transfer will use
  account settings from the asset/asset profile instead.
