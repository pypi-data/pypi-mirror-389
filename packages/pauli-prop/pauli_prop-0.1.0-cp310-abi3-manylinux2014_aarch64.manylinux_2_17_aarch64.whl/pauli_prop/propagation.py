    This shifts all recognized Clifford gates to the beginning of the circuit and updates the bases of
    Pauli-rotation gates (e.g. ``RxGate``, ``RzzGate``, ``PauliEvolutionGate``) and `PauliLindbladError <https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-aer/stubs/qiskit_aer.noise.PauliLindbladError.html#qiskit_aer.noise.PauliLindbladError>`_

    of Paulis by Cliffords.

    The effect is similar to going to the Clifford interaction picture in `arXiv:2306.04797 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04797>`_ but
    without mapping all rotation angle magnitudes to be :math:`\leq \pi/4`.

    The function returns two objects representing the Clifford and non-Clifford parts of the circuit.

    Args:
        circuit: The ``QuantumCircuit`` to transform. Can contain only Pauli-rotation gates, ``PauliLindbladError`` (appended to the
            circuit as quantum channels), and recognized Clifford gates.

    Evolution is performed in the Pauli basis by summing terms of the form :math:`U_i O_j U_k`
    (neglecting the dagger, see note below). The number of such terms is cubic in operator size (`len(op1) * len(op2)**2`)
    and will generally include many duplicate Paulis.

    Setting `max_terms` produces an approximate result, where only the `max_terms` largest terms (in coefficient magnitude)
    are computed. This can be much faster but results in some error due to truncation of smaller terms.

    The approximate computation involves two parts: searching for the terms to keep, then computing those terms. Increasing
    ``search_step`` greatly (cubically) speeds up the search, at an accuracy cost that is often small.

    It is possible that some Paulis present in the kept terms would have also appeared in the truncated terms. Because such
    truncated terms are never computed, they cannot possibly be merged into the kept terms sharing the same Pauli. Thus, the
    ``n``th-largest term in the approximate result is not guaranteed to equal the nth-largest term in the exact result.
    Likewise, convergence to the exact result with increasing ``max_terms`` can be non-monotonic.

            When ``max_terms`` is ``None`` and the number of qubits is < 12, the propagation will be performed in the computational
            basis using matrix multiplication. For systems > 12 qubits, all Pauli terms are computed and summed; however, this is
            usually not a good way to compute exact evolution due to the many duplicate terms present.

        num_leading_terms: The number of terms in ``op1`` to conjugate by every term in ``op2``. The set of included terms
            is expanded to include its union with the set of terms :math:`U_i O_j U_i†`, for :math:`j < num_leading_terms`.
