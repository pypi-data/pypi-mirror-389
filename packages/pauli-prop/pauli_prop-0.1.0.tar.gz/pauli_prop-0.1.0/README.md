# Pauli Prop

### About

Pauli propagation is a framework for approximating the evolution of operators in the Pauli basis
under the action of other operators, such as quantum circuit gates and noise channels [1] - [5].
This approach can be effective when the operators involved are expected to remain sparse in the
Pauli basis. The technique has been used to classically estimate expectation values of quantum
systems and also to reduce the depths of quantum circuits to be run on a quantum processor [6].

This package provides a Rust-accelerated Python interface for performing Pauli propagation. The
subroutines in this package may be used to implement:

- Lightcone shading [7] and other novel error mitigation techniques
- Operator backpropagation (OBP) [6]
- Classical simulation of expectation values [[tutorials](https://qiskit.github.io/pauli-prop/tutorials/index.html)]
  
##### Technical details

- Rust-accelerated Python interface
- Ability to truncate operator terms during evolution based on an absolute coefficient
tolerance, a fixed number of terms in the evolving operator, or a combination of both.
- Ability to perform Pauli propagation in both the Schrödinger and Heisenberg frameworks.
- Novel technique for approximating the conjugation of two Pauli-sum operators. This heuristic
implementation greedily generates contributions to the product expected to be most significant.

##### Computational requirements

Both the memory and time cost for Pauli propagation routines generally scale with the size to which
the evolved operator is allowed to grow.

``propagate_through_rotation_gates``: As the Pauli operator is propagated in the Pauli basis under
the action of a sequence of $N$ Pauli rotation gates of an $M$-qubit circuit, the number of terms
will grow as $\mathcal{O}(2^{N})$ towards a maximum of $4^M$ unique Pauli components. To control
the memory usage, the operator is truncated after application of each gate, which introduces some
error proportional to the magnitudes of the truncated terms' coefficients. The memory requirements
are generally linear in the size of the evolved operator and runtime scales linearly in both the
operator size and the number of gates.

``propagate_through_operator``: Conjugates one operator in the Pauli basis by another by greedily
accumulating terms in the sum, $\sum_{i,j,k}G^{\dagger}_iO_jG_k$, where $i,j,k$ are sparse indices
over the Pauli basis. This implementation sorts the coefficients in each operator by descending
magnitude then searches the 3D index space for the terms with the largest coefficients, starting
with the origin, $(0, 0, 0)$, and accumulating $(i,j,k)$ triplets up to a specified cutoff. The time
spent searching can often be made negligible by increasing the search step size in $(i,j,k)$ space,
which provides a cubic speedup for this subroutine. In our profiling, significant time can be spent
sorting the operators and performing Pauli multiplication to generate the terms in the new operator.
