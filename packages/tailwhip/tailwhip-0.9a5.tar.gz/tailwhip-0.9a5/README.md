# Tailwhip — Tailwind CSS class sorter

Tailwhip is a pure Python Tailwind CSS class sorter that works with any HTML or CSS
file — including Django templates and other templating languages.

## Why Tailwhip?

The [official Prettier plugin][1] for sorting Tailwind classes doesn’t play well
with many template languages, such as Django. While there are Prettier plugins that
add limited support for [Jinja templates][2], they often require configuration
workarounds or restrict what you can do with Prettier.

Tailwhip takes a more pragmatic approach. Instead of trying to parse and understand
every possible template syntax, it focuses on sorting Tailwind classes reliably, and
ignores class attributes that contain template syntax.

How it works:

1. It finds all `class=""` attributes and `@apply` directives in the given files.
2. It sorts the contained classes according to the official Tailwind CSS class order.
3. If a class attribute contains template syntax (e.g., `{{ ... }}` or `{% ... %}`),
   Tailwhip leaves it untouched.

This approach ensures Tailwhip works across diverse environments — Django, Flask,
Jinja2, or even custom templating engines — without breaking your templates or
requiring complicated setup.

## Usage

Tailwhip requires Python 3.11 or later.

```bash
$ uvx tailwhip [options] [filepath...]

# Find all .html and .css files in the templates directory
$ uvx tailwhip templates/

# Preview changes
$ uvx tailwhip templates/ -vv

# Actually apply changes
$ uvx tailwhip templates/ --write

# Sort classes in .scss files
$ uvx tailwhip "templates/**/*.scss"

# Standard glob patterns are supported
$ uvx tailwhip "static/**/*.{css,scss}" "templates/**/*.htm[l]"
```

You can also install it with pip and use it as a Python library:

```bash
$ pip install tailwhip

$ tailwhip templates/
$ python -m tailwhip templates/
```

See `--help` for all options and features.
