           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## 🏃 Getting Started

Let's see a simple example on how to use Uni2TS to make zero-shot forecasts from a pre-trained model. 
We first load our data using pandas, in the form of a wide DataFrame. 
Uni2TS relies on GluonTS for inference as it provides many convenience functions for time series forecasting, such as splitting a dataset into a train/test split and performing rolling evaluations, as demonstrated below.

```python
import torch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from gluonts.dataset.pandas import PandasDataset
from gluonts.dataset.split import split
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

from uni2ts.eval_util.plot import plot_single
from uni2ts.model.moirai import MoiraiForecast, MoiraiModule
from uni2ts.model.moirai_moe import MoiraiMoEForecast, MoiraiMoEModule

MODEL = "moirai2"  # model name: choose from {'moirai', 'moirai-moe', 'moirai2'}
SIZE = "small"  # model size: choose from {'small', 'base', 'large'}
PDT = 20  # prediction length: any positive integer
CTX = 200  # context length: any positive integer
PSZ = "auto"  # patch size: choose from {"auto", 8, 16, 32, 64, 128}
BSZ = 32  # batch size: any positive integer
TEST = 100  # test set length: any positive integer

# Read data into pandas DataFrame
url = (
    "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rsnirwan/c8c8654a98350fadd229b00167174ec4"
    "/raw/a42101c7786d4bc7695228a0f2c8cea41340e18f/ts_wide.csv"
)
df = pd.read_csv(url, index_col=0, parse_dates=True)

# Convert into GluonTS dataset
ds = PandasDataset(dict(df))

# Split into train/test set
train, test_template = split(
    ds, offset=-TEST
)  # assign last TEST time steps as test set

# Construct rolling window evaluation
test_data = test_template.generate_instances(
    prediction_length=PDT,  # number of time steps for each prediction
    windows=TEST // PDT,  # number of windows in rolling window evaluation
    distance=PDT,  # number of time steps between each window - distance=PDT for non-overlapping windows
)

# Prepare pre-trained model by downloading model weights from huggingface hub

## 📔 Jupyter Notebook Examples
See the [example folder](example) for more examples on common tasks, e.g. visualizing forecasts, predicting from pandas DataFrame, etc.

## 💻 Command Line Interface
We provide several scripts which act as a [command line interface](cli) to easily run fine-tuning, evaluation, and even pre-training jobs. 
[Configurations](cli/conf) are managed with the [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) framework.

### Fine-tuning
Firstly, let's see how to use Uni2TS to fine-tune a pre-trained model on your custom dataset. 
Uni2TS uses the [Hugging Face datasets library](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) to handle data loading, and we first need to convert your dataset into the Uni2TS format. 
If your dataset is a simple pandas DataFrame, we can easily process your dataset with the following script.
We'll use the ETTh1 dataset from the popular [Long Sequence Forecasting benchmark](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library) for this example.
For more complex use cases, see [this notebook](example/prepare_data.ipynb) for more in-depth examples on how to use your custom dataset with Uni2TS. For formal LSF finetuning experiments based on original configurations, see [this folder](./project/moirai-1) for shell scripts and more detailed examples.

1. To begin the process, add the path to the directory where you want to save the processed dataset into the ```.env``` file.
```shell
echo "CUSTOM_DATA_PATH=PATH_TO_SAVE" >> .env
```

2. Run the following script to process the dataset into the required format. For the ```dataset_type``` option, we support `wide`, `long` and `wide_multivariate`. 
```shell
python -m uni2ts.data.builder.simple ETTh1 dataset/ETT-small/ETTh1.csv --dataset_type wide
```

However, we may want validation set during fine-tuning to perform hyperparameter tuning or early stopping.
To additionally split the dataset into a train and validation split we can use the mutually exclusive ```date_offset``` (datetime string) or ```offset``` (integer) options which determines the last time step of the train set.
The validation set will be saved as DATASET_NAME_eval.
```shell
python -m uni2ts.data.builder.simple ETTh1 dataset/ETT-small/ETTh1.csv --date_offset '2017-10-23 23:00:00'
```

In some cases, we may want to normalize the data using the mean and std computed from the training dataset. This can be achieved by setting the ```--normalize``` argument.

```shell
python -m uni2ts.data.builder.simple ETTh1 dataset/ETT-small/ETTh1.csv --date_offset '2017-10-23 23:00:00' --normalize
```


3. Finally, we can simply run the fine-tuning script with the appropriate [training](cli/conf/finetune/data/etth1.yaml) and [validation](cli/conf/finetune/val_data/etth1.yaml) data configuration files. Forecasting configurations such as patch size, context length and prediction length need to be specified by users.  Since ```dataset_type``` is ```wide```, ```data.mode``` is set to `S` for univariate setup.
```shell
python -m cli.train \
  -cp conf/finetune \
  exp_name=example_lsf \
  run_name=example_run \
  model=moirai_1.0_R_small \
  model.patch_size=32 \
  model.context_length=1000 \
  model.prediction_length=96 \
  data=etth1 \
  data.patch_size=32 \
  data.context_length=1000 \
  data.prediction_length=96 \
  data.mode=S \
  val_data=etth1 \
  val_data.patch_size=32 \
  val_data.context_length=1000 \
  val_data.prediction_length=96 \
  val_data.mode=S
```

### Evaluation

The evaluation script can be used to calculate evaluation metrics such as MSE, MASE, CRPS, and so on (see the [configuration file](cli/conf/eval/default.yaml)). 

Given a test split (see previous section on processing datasets), we can run the following command to evaluate it:
```shell
python -m cli.eval \ 
  run_name=example_eval_1 \
  model=moirai_1.0_R_small \
  model.patch_size=32 \ 
  model.context_length=1000 \
  data=etth1_test
```

Alternatively, we provide access to popular datasets, and can be toggled via the [data configurations](cli/conf/eval/data).
As an example, say we want to perform evaluation, again on the ETTh1 dataset from the popular [Long Sequence Forecasting benchmark](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library).
We first need to download the pre-processed datasets and put them in the correct directory, by setting up the TSLib repository and following the instructions.
Then, assign the dataset directory to the `LSF_PATH` environment variable:
```shell
echo "LSF_PATH=PATH_TO_TSLIB/dataset" >> .env
```

Thereafter, simply run the following script with the predefined [Hydra config file](cli/conf/eval/data/lsf_test.yaml):
```shell
python -m cli.eval \ 
  run_name=example_eval_2 \
  model=moirai_1.0_R_small \
  model.patch_size=32 \ 
  model.context_length=1000 \ 
  data=lsf_test \
  data.dataset_name=ETTh1 \
  data.prediction_length=96 
```

### Pre-training
Now, let's see how you can pre-train your own model. 
We'll start with preparing the data for pre-training first, by downloading the [Large-scale Open Time Series Archive (LOTSA data)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/lotsa_data/).
Assuming you've already createed a `.env` file, run the following commands.
```shell
huggingface-cli download Salesforce/lotsa_data --repo-type=dataset --local-dir PATH_TO_SAVE
echo "LOTSA_V1_PATH=PATH_TO_SAVE" >> .env
```

Then, we can simply run the following script to start a pre-training job. 
See the [relevant](cli/train.py) [files](cli/conf/pretrain) on how to further customize the settings.
```shell
python -m cli.train \
  -cp conf/pretrain \
  run_name=first_run \
  model=moirai_small \
  data=lotsa_v1_unweighted
```
