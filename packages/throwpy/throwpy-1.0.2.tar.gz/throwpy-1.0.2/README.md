# 🧰 ThrowPy

**ThrowPy** is a lightweight Python library that provides a simple and elegant way to make any function or class method *"throwable"*, similar to Java-style exception handling.

It offers an easy-to-use decorator — `@ThrowableExcept` — that automatically catches exceptions, prints meaningful error messages, and optionally logs them to a file.
