# 🧰 ThrowPy

**ThrowPy** is a lightweight Python library that provides a simple and elegant way to make any function or class method *"throwable"*, similar to Java-style exception handling.

It offers an easy-to-use decorator — `@ThrowableExcept` — that automatically catches exceptions, prints meaningful error messages, and optionally logs them to a file.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔹 Simple decorator-based usage  
- 🔹 Automatic exception catching with file and line context  
- 🔹 Optional file logging (`logErr=True`)  
- 🔹 Works with both functions and class methods  
- 🔹 Minimal dependencies (pure Python)  
- 🔹 Python 3.8+ compatible

## 📦 Installation

You can install **ThrowPy** directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/throwpy/):

```bash
pip install throwpy
