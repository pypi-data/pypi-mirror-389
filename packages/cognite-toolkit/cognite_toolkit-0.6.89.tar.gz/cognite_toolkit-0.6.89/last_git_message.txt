[CDF-26167] Mixpanel subcommand list (#2169)

# Description

For event type ...Command we currently track subcommands like
positionalArg0, positionalArg1 . Let’s use the list type property to
capture subcommands in a subcommand list instead.

(Not making a distinction between app/command here, just calling
everything after `cdf` a subcommand.)

So 

```
ModulesCommand 
positionalArg0 modules
positionalArg1 upgrade
```

becomes 

```

ModulesCommand 
subcommands [“modules”, “upgrade”]

```
