### cdf modules init

- A package bundle is downloaded (user refers to an external library):
`downloadedPackageIds[]` and **downloadedModuleIds** sent to Mixpanel
- Package(s) and module(s) are selected and created in the modules
folder: `installedPackageIds` and **installedModuleIds** sent to
Mixpanel

### cdf build
event: commandBuild
- Package(s) and Modules(s) are built: `PackageIds` and `ModuleIds` are
sent to Mixpanel
- If available, `project` and `cluster` are sent to Mixpanel

### cdf deploy
event: commandDeploy
- Package(s) and Modules(s) are deployed: `PackageIds` and `ModuleIds`
are sent to Mixpanel
