[CDF-25834] 🏰 Rework purge dataset Part 4 (#2148)

# Description

This is part 1 of reimplementing the cdf purge dataset command. 

This PR set up the CLI interface and remove the old implementation.

The motivation for this reimplementation is as follows:
* We have new components such as HTTPClient and WorkerProducer that will
be very useful for running the purge code.
* The current implementation lacks proper testing, a reimplementation
will ensure it is well tested.

### Improved

- The `cdf purge dataset` has been reworked. It now gives progress bar
when deleting. It is also robust against individual items failing to
delete. [alpha] If you enable the alpha flag `v07=true` you will get
further options like deleting assets recursively, select whether to
delete only data or only configurations, or both.
