## cdf 

### Improved

- The `cdf purge dataset` has been reworked. It now gives progress bar
when deleting. It is also robust against individual items failing to
delete. [alpha] If you enable the alpha flag `v07=true` you will get
further options like deleting assets recursively, select whether to
delete only data or only configurations, or both.
