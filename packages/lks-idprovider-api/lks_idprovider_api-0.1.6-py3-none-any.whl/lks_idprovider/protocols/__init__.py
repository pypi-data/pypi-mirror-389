"""Protocol definitions for LKS Identity Provider.

This module contains the protocol definitions that all provider implementations
must follow. These protocols define the contracts for:

- Identity providers (user authentication)
- Client credentials providers (service-to-service authentication)
- Cache providers (optional caching support)

All protocols work with the unified Identity model where both users and clients
are represented as Identity instances with specific subclasses.
