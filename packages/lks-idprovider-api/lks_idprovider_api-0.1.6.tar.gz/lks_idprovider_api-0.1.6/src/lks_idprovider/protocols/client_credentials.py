"""Client Credentials Provider protocol definition.

This module defines the ClientCredentialsProvider protocol for service-to-service
REST API security. It handles validation of client tokens obtained through OAuth 2.0
Client Credentials flow, rather than performing the initial token acquisition.

This is designed for securing service-to-service API calls where:
- Services have already obtained client access tokens
- The API needs to validate client tokens and extract client identity
- Authorization decisions are made based on client roles and scopes
- Focus is on token validation and client info extraction
