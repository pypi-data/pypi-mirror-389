    Introduced the Qiskit addon for optimization modeling, designed to support utility-scale workloads powered by Qiskit.
    This package enables the formulation and transformation of combinatorial optimization problems into quantum-ready formats.
    It supports modeling of QUBO and HUBO problems, with higher-order terms represented as polynomials or monomials, and
    facilitates the creation of Hamiltonians whose ground states correspond to optimal solutions.

    Core modules include:
      - **applications**: Provides model implementations for common optimization problems.
      - **converters**: Converters facilitate transformations between different representations and interpretation of solutions. 
      - **problems**: Defines optimization problems including objective functions, constraints, and variable types.
      - **solvers**: Implements interfaces for modelling validation using classical solvers.
      - **translators**: Converts optimization problem into additional optimization models.
