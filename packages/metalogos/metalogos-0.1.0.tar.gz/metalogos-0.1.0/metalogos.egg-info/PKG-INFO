# 🧠📜 metalogos — Where Logic Meets Longing

`metalogos` is a Python library for **reflective computation** — a fusion of  
mathematics and meaning, philosophy and code.  

It provides meditative utilities that quantify uncertainty, simulate ethics,  
and measure the resonance of ideas.

---

## 🌌 Philosophy

Most libraries *predict*.  
This one *pauses.*  

Where others compute outcomes, `metalogos` explores *interpretations*.  
It doesn’t seek the most efficient answer — it seeks the most **human** question.

It’s a small act of rebellion in a world of optimization:  
a toolkit for those who still believe that ambiguity, beauty, and reflection  
belong in code.

## ✨ Features

| Domain | Module | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 🌀 **Uncertainty** | `entropy` | Quantifies existential entropy in text or data |
| ⚖️ **Ethics** | `ethics` | Simulates moral trade-offs and philosophical choices |
| 💬 **Meaning** | `semantics` | Measures resonance between words and concepts |
| 🧠 **Mind** | `mind` | Models belief-based agents with limited rationality |
| 🎨 **Aesthetics** | `aesthetics` | Quantifies symmetry and beauty in data |
