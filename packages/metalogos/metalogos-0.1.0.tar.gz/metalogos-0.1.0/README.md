`metalogos` is a Python library for **reflective computation** — a fusion of  
mathematics and meaning, philosophy and code.  

It provides meditative utilities that quantify uncertainty, simulate ethics,  
and measure the resonance of ideas.

---

## 🌌 Philosophy

Most libraries *predict*.  
This one *pauses.*  

Where others compute outcomes, `metalogos` explores *interpretations*.  
It doesn’t seek the most efficient answer — it seeks the most **human** question.

It’s a small act of rebellion in a world of optimization:  
a toolkit for those who still believe that ambiguity, beauty, and reflection  
belong in code.
