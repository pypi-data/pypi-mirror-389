  - Must include a copy of the license with any distribution of the Covered Source.
  - Must include copyright notices in any distribution of the Covered Source.
  - Must include notices of any changes made to the Covered Source.
  key_requirements:
  - Ensure that any modifications made to the Covered Source are documented.
  - Treat any Source derived from the Covered Source as licensed under CERN-OHL-W
    or a Compatible Licence.
  - Do not imply endorsement by CERN when using the license.
