    notes: This license is copyleft-weak, meaning it allows modifications and derivative
      works to be distributed under a different license.
  obligations:
  - Insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed
    that file.
  - Make your modifications Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications
    to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
    site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications
    in the Standard Version of the Package.
  key_requirements:
  - 'You must make at least one of the following: place your modifications in the
    Public Domain, make them Freely Available, use the modified Package only within
    your corporation or organization, rename non-standard executables and provide
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents
    how it differs from the Standard Version.'
