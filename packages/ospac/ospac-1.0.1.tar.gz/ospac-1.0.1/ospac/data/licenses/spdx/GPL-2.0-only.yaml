    notes: The GPL-2.0-only license requires that any derivative works or combined
      works be licensed under the same license. This strong copyleft effect means
      that it is generally incompatible with permissive licenses.
  obligations:
  - Distribute copies of the software with the same license.
  - Provide source code or access to it when distributing the software.
  - Include a copy of the GPL license with any distributed software.
  - State any changes made to the original software.
  key_requirements:
  - Must provide the same freedoms to recipients as received.
  - Must not impose additional restrictions on the rights granted by the license.
  - Must ensure that any distributed modified versions are also licensed under GPL-2.0-only.
