    notes: The GPL-2.0 license requires that any derivative work or combined work
      must also be licensed under GPL-2.0. This strong copyleft nature means that
      any software that incorporates GPL-2.0 licensed code must also be open-sourced
      under the same license.
  obligations:
  - Distribute copies of the software with the same license.
  - Provide access to the source code when distributing the software.
  - Include a copy of the license with any distributed software.
  - State any changes made to the original software.
  key_requirements:
  - Must provide the same freedoms to recipients as received.
  - Must not impose additional restrictions on the rights granted by the license.
  - Must ensure that any distributed modified versions are also licensed under GPL-2.0.
