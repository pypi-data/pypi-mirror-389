    notes: The GPL-3.0 license has a strong copyleft effect, meaning that any derivative
      work must also be licensed under GPL-3.0. This applies to both static and dynamic
      linking.
  obligations:
  - Distribute the source code or provide access to it when distributing binaries.
  - Include a copy of the GPL license with any distributed software.
  - Include copyright notices of the original authors.
  - State any changes made to the original software.
  - Distribute modified versions under the same GPL license.
  key_requirements:
  - Ensure that all recipients receive the same freedoms you received.
  - Do not impose additional restrictions on the rights granted by the GPL.
  - Mark modified versions to distinguish them from the original.
