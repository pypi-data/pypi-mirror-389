    notes: The GPL-3.0-with-autoconf-exception license requires that any derivative
      work or combined work must also be licensed under GPL-3.0 or a compatible license.
      Static linking typically leads to full contamination, while dynamic linking
      may allow for some exceptions depending on the nature of the linking.
  obligations:
  - If you modify Autoconf and cause Ineligible Code to become Normally Copied Code,
    you must remove the Exception.
  - You must include the GPLv3 license text when distributing the software.
  - You must provide a copy of the license with any distribution.
  key_requirements:
  - Maintain the copyleft provisions of the GPLv3 for any derivative works.
  - State any changes made to the original code.
  - Include copyright notices and license information in all copies or substantial
    portions of the software.
