    notes: The GPL-2.0-with-autoconf-exception allows linking with certain licenses,
      but care must be taken with proprietary licenses. The exception allows for the
      use of the library in a way that does not impose the GPL on the entire application.
  obligations:
  - Must disclose source code when distributing modified versions.
  - Must include a copy of the GPL license when distributing the software.
  - Must include copyright notices from the original authors.
  - Must include notices of any changes made to the original software.
  - If distributing modified versions of Autoconf, must not include the Autoconf exception
    if the modifications could copy non-data portions.
  key_requirements:
  - Comply with the terms of the GPL v2 for all uses except for the configure scripts
    generated by Autoconf.
  - If modifying Autoconf, ensure that the special exception is not included if non-data
    portions are copied.
