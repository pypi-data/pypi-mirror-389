        Visualize the graph with `gravis`.

        Set the `gravis_style` keyword argument, a dictionary containing
        gravis styling directives for nodes and edges, to customize
        the appearance of the graph.

        By default, this method will fetch all necessary (node, edge, and
        node/edge property) data and cache it locally. To use the most
        recently cached data instead of fetching fresh data, set
        the `use_fetch_cache` argument to `True`; this is useful
        to tighten the iteration loop when customizing the visualization.

        By default, this method uses the `gravis.vis(...)` method for visualization.
        `vis` builds an interactive, two-dimensional graph view using `vis.js`
        (DOM/canvas). This method is simple and lightweight, but lacks some
        styling features (e.g., separate arrow colors and per-element opacity),
        so those options are ignored. Alternatively, set the `use_gravis_three`
        argument to `True` to use `gravis.three(...)`, which builds an interactive,
        three-dimensional graph view using `3d-force-graph`, which in turn uses
        `three.js`/WebGL. You get a draggable three-dimensional scene with
        force-layout physics; some features (e.g., node borders, edge labels)
        aren’t available compared to other back-ends.

        Any other keyword arguments will be passed through to `gravis`, merged
        with the following default keyword arguments.
        ```
            "node_label_data_source": "label",
            "edge_label_data_source": "label",
            "show_edge_label": True,
            "edge_curvature": 0.4,

        The ``neighbor()`` method, called with no parameters, computes and caches
        the full neighbor relationship, providing efficient reuse across multiple
        calls to ``neighbor()``. In contrast, ``neighbor(of=subset)`` computes a
        constrained relationship specific to the passed-in ``subset`` and that
        call site. When a significant fraction of the neighbor relation is needed
        across a program, ``neighbor()`` is typically more efficient; this is the
        typical case. Use ``neighbor(of=subset)`` only when small subsets of the
        neighbor relationship are needed collectively across the program.

        Notes
        -----
        The ``indegree()`` method, called with no parameters, computes and caches
        the full indegree relationship, providing efficient reuse across multiple
        calls to ``indegree()``. In contrast, ``indegree(of=subset)`` computes a
        constrained relationship specific to the passed-in ``subset`` and that
        call site. When a significant fraction of the indegree relation is needed
        across a program, ``indegree()`` is typically more efficient; this is the
        typical case. Use ``indegree(of=subset)`` only when small subsets of the
        indegree relationship are needed collectively across the program.

        The ``weighted_degree()`` method, called with no parameters, computes and caches
        the full weighted degree relationship, providing efficient reuse across multiple
        calls to ``weighted_degree()``. In contrast, ``weighted_degree(of=subset)`` computes a
        constrained relationship specific to the passed-in ``subset`` and that
        call site. When a significant fraction of the weighted degree relation is needed
        across a program, ``weighted_degree()`` is typically more efficient; this is the
        typical case. Use ``weighted_degree(of=subset)`` only when small subsets of the
        weighted degree relationship are needed collectively across the program.

        Degree centrality is a measure of a node's importance, defined as its

        For unewighted graphs without self-loops, this value will be at most 1.0;

        Notes
        -----
        The ``degree_centrality()`` method, called with no parameters, computes and caches
        the full degree centrality relationship, providing efficient reuse across multiple
        calls to ``degree_centrality()``. In contrast, ``degree_centrality(of=subset)`` computes a
        constrained relationship specific to the passed-in ``subset`` and that
        call site. When a significant fraction of the degree centrality relation is needed
        across a program, ``degree_centrality()`` is typically more efficient; this is the
        typical case. Use ``degree_centrality(of=subset)`` only when small subsets of the
        degree centrality relationship are needed collectively across the program.

        Eigenvector centrality is a measure of the centrality or importance
        of a node in a graph based on finding the eigenvector associated
        with the top eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. We use the power
        method to compute the eigenvector in our implementation. Note that
        the power method `requires the adjacency matrix to be diagonalizable <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration>`_
        and will only converge if the absolute value of the top 2
        eigenvalues is distinct. Thus, if the graph you are using has an
        adjacency matrix that is not diagonalizable or the top two
        eigenvalues are not distinct, this method will not converge.

        In the case of weighted graphs, weights are assumed to be non-negative.

        Notes
        -----

        Calculating betweenness centrality involves computing all of the shortest paths between
        every pair of nodes in a graph and can be expensive to calculate exactly. The
        `betweenness_centrality` relation gives an approximation using the
        [Brandes-Pich](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218127407018403)
        algorithm, which samples nodes uniformly at random and performs single-source
        shortest-path computations from those nodes.

        This implementation nominally samples 100 nodes, yielding time complexity of
        `100 * O(|V|+|E|))`. If the graph has fewer than 100 nodes, it reduces to the
        [Brandes algorithm](http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/brandes01centrality.pdf),
        with time complexity `O(|V|(|V|+|E|))` for unweighted graphs.

        Notes
        -----
        This relationship contains triples of nodes `(a, b, c)` representing
        unique triangles.

        For **undirected graphs**, uniqueness of each triangle is guaranteed
        because the relationship only contains triples where `a < b < c`.

        For **directed graphs**, the triple `(a, b, c)` represents a triangle
        with directed edges `(a, b)`, `(b, c)`, and `(c, a)`, and is unique up
        to ordering of the nodes and direction of the edges. `unique_triangle`
        only contains triples such that `a < b`, `a < c`, and `b != c`. For
        example, the triples `(1, 2, 3)` and `(1, 3, 2)` represent two unique
        directed triangles.

        Notes

        The ``triangle_count()`` method, called with no parameters, computes and caches
        the full triangle count relationship, providing efficient reuse across multiple
        calls to ``triangle_count()``. In contrast, ``triangle_count(of=subset)`` computes a
        constrained relationship specific to the passed-in ``subset`` and that
        call site. When a significant fraction of the triangle count relation is needed
        across a program, ``triangle_count()`` is typically more efficient; this is the
        typical case. Use ``triangle_count(of=subset)`` only when small subsets of the
        triangle count relationship are needed collectively across the program.

        Notes
        -----
        This method finds K-clique communities (with `K = 3`) using the
        `percolation method <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_percolation_method>`_.
        A triangle community is the union of nodes of all triangles that can
        be reached from one another by adjacent triangles---that is,
        triangles that share exactly two nodes.

        For a given undirected graph `G`, the algorithm works as follows:
        First, all triangles in `G` are enumerated and assigned a unique
        label, each of which becomes a node in a new graph called the
        **clique-graph** of `G`, where two nodes in this new graph are
        connected by an edge if the corresponding triangles share exactly two
        nodes, i.e., the corresponding triangles are adjacent in `G`. Next,
        the connected components of the clique-graph of `G` are computed and
        then assigned community labels. Finally, each node in the original
        graph is assigned the community label of the triangle to which it
        belongs. Nodes that are not contained in any triangle are not
        assigned a community label. This algorithm is not supported for
        directed graphs since adjacency is not defined for directed
        triangles.

        Notes
        -----
        The local clustering coefficient for node `v` is::

            (2 * num_neighbor_edges(v)) / (ext_degree(v) * (ext_degree(v) - 1))

        where `num_neighbor_edges(v)` is the number of edges between
        the neighbors of node `v`, and `ext_degree(v)` is the degree of the
        node excluding self-loops. If `ext_degree(v)` is less than 2,
        the local clustering coefficient is 0.0.

        The ``local_clustering_coefficient()`` method, called with no parameters, computes
        and caches the full local clustering coefficient relationship, providing efficient
        reuse across multiple calls to ``local_clustering_coefficient()``. In contrast,
        ``local_clustering_coefficient(of=subset)`` computes a constrained relationship
        specific to the passed-in ``subset`` and that call site. When a significant fraction
        of the local clustering coefficient relation is needed across a program,
        ``local_clustering_coefficient()`` is typically more efficient; this is the typical
        case. Use ``local_clustering_coefficient(of=subset)`` only when small subsets of the
        local clustering coefficient relationship are needed collectively across the program.

        Notes
        -----
        There is a slight difference between `transitive closure` and
        `reachable_from`. The transitive closure of a binary relation E is the
        smallest relation that contains E and is transitive. When E is the
        edge set of a graph, the transitive closure of E does not include
        (u, u) if u is isolated. `reachable_from` is a different binary
        relation in which any node u is always reachable from u. In
        particular, `transitive closure` is a more general concept than
        `reachable_from`.

        Notes
        -----
        This method is used to determine the range of possible diameter
        values in the graph. This is done by selecting a number of random
        nodes in the graph and taking the maximum of all shortest paths
        lengths to the rest of the graph. This gives a range per node.
        Then, the intersection of these ranges is taken and the final range
        is returned.

        For disconnected graphs, `diameter_range` returns the diameter range
        of the largest (weakly) connected component. This behavior deviates
        from many graph theory resources, which typically define the diameter
        of a disconnected graph as infinity.

        Notes
        -----
        The **unweighted** Jaccard similarity between two nodes is the ratio of
        the size of the intersection to the size of the union of their
        neighbors (or out-neighbors for directed graphs).

        The **weighted** Jaccard similarity considers the weights of the edges.
        The definition used here is taken from the reference noted below. It is
        the ratio between two quantities:

        1.  **Numerator**: For every other node `w` in the graph, find the
            minimum of the edge weights `(u, w)` and `(v, w)`, and sum these
            minimums.
        2.  **Denominator**: For every other node `w` in the graph, find the
            maximum of the edge weights `(u, w)` and `(v, w)`, and sum these
            maximums.

        If an edge does not exist, its weight is considered 0.0. This can be
        better understood via the following calculation for the weighted
        example below.

        | node id | edge weights to node 1 | edge weights to node 2 | min  | max  |
        | :------ | :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :--- | :--- |
        | 1       | 0.0                    | 1.6                    | 0.0  | 1.6  |
        | 2       | 1.6                    | 0.0                    | 0.0  | 1.6  |
        | 3       | 1.4                    | 0.46                   | 0.46 | 1.4  |
        | 4       | 0.0                    | 0.0                    | 0.0  | 0.0  |

        The weighted Jaccard similarity between node 1 and 2 is then:
        `0.46 / (1.6 + 1.6 + 1.4) = 0.1`.

        Notes
        -----
        The cosine similarity is defined as the normalized inner product of
        two vectors representing the neighborhoods of the nodes `u` and `v`.
        For directed graphs, only out-neighbors are considered.

        * For **unweighted** graphs, the vector for a node `u` contains a 1
            for each neighbor and a 0 for each non-neighbor.
        * For **weighted** graphs, the vector for a node `u` contains the
            edge weight for each neighbor and a 0 for each non-neighbor.

        Edge weights are assumed to be non-negative, so the neighborhood
        vectors contain only non-negative elements. Therefore, the cosine
        similarity score is always between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.

        Notes
        -----
        This implementation of Infomap minimizes the map equation via a
        Louvain-like optimization heuristic; this is often referred to as
        "core" Infomap in the literature. Computation of the ergodic node
        visit frequencies is done via regularized power iteration, with
        regularization via a uniform teleportation probability of 0.15,
        matching the nominal selection in the literature.

        **Unweighted Graph Example**

        Compute community assignments for each node in an undirected graph. Here,
        an undirected dumbbell graph resolves into two communities, namely its
        two constituent three-cliques.

        two three-cliques constituent of the dumbbell embedded in the six-clique.
