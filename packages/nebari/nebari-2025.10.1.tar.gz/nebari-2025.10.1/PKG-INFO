> **Nebari Deployment Issues**
>
> The current stable releases on PyPI and conda-forge suffer from issues related to [Bitnami image deprecation](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/35164) that prevent successful deployments.
> These issues have been resolved on the `main` branch and will be included in the upcoming `2025.10.1` release.
>
> If trying to deploy nebari in the meantime, please install directly from the `main` branch e.g. `pip install git+https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari.git@main`.

Automated data science platform. From [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub "Multi-user version of the Notebook") to Cloud environments with
[Dask Gateway](https://docs.dask.org/ "Parallel computing in Python").

Nebari is an open source data platform that enables users to build and maintain cost-effective and scalable compute platforms
on [HPC](#nebari-hpc) or [Kubernetes](#nebari) with minimal DevOps overhead.

**This repository details the [Nebari](https://nebari.dev/ "Official Nebari docs") (Kubernetes) version.**

Not sure what to choose? Check out our documentation on [choosing a deployment platform](https://www.nebari.dev/docs/get-started/deploy)

## Nebari

The Kubernetes version of Nebari uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Helm](https://helm.sh/), and
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions).

- Terraform handles the build, change, and versioning of the infrastructure.
- Helm helps to define, install, and manage [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/ "Automated container deployment, scaling, and management") resources.
- GitHub Actions is used to automatically create commits when the configuration file (`nebari-config.yaml`) is rendered,
  as well as to kick off the deployment action.

Nebari aims to abstract all these complexities for its users.
Hence, it is not necessary to know any of the technologies mentioned above to have your project successfully deployed.

> TLDR: If you know GitHub and feel comfortable generating and using API keys, you should have all it takes to deploy and maintain your system without the need for a dedicated
> DevOps team. No need to learn Kubernetes, Terraform, or Helm.

### Cloud Providers ☁️

Nebari offers out-of-the-box support for the major public cloud providers:
Amazon [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/ "Google Cloud Provider"), and Microsoft [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).

## Installation 💻

### Pre-requisites

- Operating System: Currently, Nebari supports development on macOS and Linux operating systems. Windows is NOT supported.
  However, we would welcome contributions that add and improve support for Windows.
- You need Python >= 3.10 on your local machine or virtual environment to work on Nebari.
- Adopting virtual environments ([`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), [`pipenv`](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) or
  [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)) is also encouraged.

### Install Nebari

To install Nebari type the following commands in your command line:

- Install using `conda`:

  ```bash
  conda install -c conda-forge nebari

  # if you prefer using mamba
  mamba install -c conda-forge nebari
  ```

- Install using `pip`:

  ```bash
  pip install nebari
  ```

Once finished, you can check Nebari's version (and additional CLI arguments) by typing:

```bash
nebari --help
```

If successful, the CLI output will be similar to the following:

```bash
usage: nebari [-h] [-v] {deploy,destroy,render,init,validate} ...

Nebari command line

positional arguments:
  {deploy,destroy,render,init,validate}
                        Nebari

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         Nebari version
```

## Usage 🚀

Nebari requires setting multiple environment variables to automate the deployments fully.
For details on obtaining those variables, check the [Nebari Get started documentation][docs-get-started].

Once all the necessary credentials are gathered and set as [UNIX environment variables](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-set-and-list-environment-variables-in-linux/), Nebari can be
deployed in minutes.

For detailed step-by-step instructions on how to deploy Nebari, check the [Nebari documentation][docs-deploy].

## Nebari HPC

An HPC version of Nebari is available for SLURM-based high-performance computing environments.
Check out the [Nebari SLURM](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari-slurm) repository.
