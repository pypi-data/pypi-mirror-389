## How to Use These Notebooks

1. **Sequential Learning Path**: Start with notebook 1 and progress through to notebook 5. Each notebook builds on concepts from previous ones.

2. **Reference Guide**: Jump to specific notebooks based on your needs:
   - New to Flow? → Start with notebook 1
   - Need to configure Flow? → See notebook 2
   - Comparing submission methods? → Check notebook 3
   - Looking for advanced patterns? → Explore notebook 4
   - Building production systems? → Study notebook 5

3. **Run Interactively**: 
   ```bash
   # Start Jupyter
   jupyter notebook
   
   # Or use Jupyter Lab
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. **Copy and Adapt**: Feel free to copy code snippets and adapt them for your use cases.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Task Management**: Submit, monitor, and control computational tasks
- **Resource Selection**: Choose optimal instances based on workload requirements
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes for data and model storage
- **Scaling**: From single tasks to distributed multi-node workflows
- **Cost Optimization**: Price limits, spot instances, auto-termination
- **Production Patterns**: Error handling, checkpointing, monitoring

## Quick Examples

### Submit a simple GPU task
```python
from flow import Flow, TaskConfig

config = TaskConfig(
    name="gpu-task",
    instance_type="gpu.nvidia.t4",
    command="python train.py"
)

with Flow() as flow:
    task = flow.run(config, wait=True)
    print(task.logs())
```

### Find available instances
```python
with Flow() as flow:
    instances = flow.find_instances({
        "max_price": 10.0,
        "min_gpu_count": 1
    })
    for inst in instances:
        print(f"{inst.instance_type}: ${inst.price_per_hour}/hr")
```

## Tips

- **Always set price limits** to avoid unexpected costs
- **Use persistent volumes** for data that needs to survive task completion
- **Start small** - test with cheaper instances before scaling up
- **Monitor your tasks** - use logs and status checks
- **Handle failures gracefully** - implement retries and checkpoints
