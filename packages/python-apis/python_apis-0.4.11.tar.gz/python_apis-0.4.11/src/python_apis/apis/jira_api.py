"""This module contains the functionality concerning the
connection and the methods that gets data from AD and can modify the AD.

This module was build as an "in the same domain" AD connection and has no plans
to extend to being able to connect through a custom user and password. Hence
this package will need a user that has the required permissions to edit/read the
AD to run it effectively.
