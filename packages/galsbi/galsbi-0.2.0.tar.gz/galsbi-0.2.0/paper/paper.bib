	abstractnote = {Simulated wide-field images are becoming an important part of observational astronomy, either to prepare for new surveys or to test measurement methods. In order to efficiently explore vast parameter spaces, the computational speed of simulation codes is a central requirement to their implementation. We introduce the Ultra Fast Image Generator (UFig) which aims to bring wide-field imaging simulations to the current limits of computational capabilities. We achieve this goal through: (1) models of galaxies, stars and observational conditions, which, while simple, capture the key features necessary for realistic simulations, and (2) state-of-the-art computational and implementation optimizations. We present the performances of UFig and show that it is faster than existing public simulation codes by several orders of magnitude. It allows us to produce images more quickly than SExtractor needs to analyze them. For instance, it can simulate a typical 0.25deg2 Subaru SuprimeCam image (10k×8k pixels) with a 5-σ limiting magnitude of R=26 in 30 s on a laptop, yielding an average simulation time for a galaxy of 30 μs. This code is complementary to end-to-end simulation codes and can be used as a fast, central component of observational methods relying on simulations. For instance, it can be used to efficiently calibrate high-precision measurements, as recently suggested for cosmic shear.}

The model is based on analytical parametrizations of galaxy luminosity functions, morphologies and spectral energy distributions. Model constraints are derived through iterative Approximate Bayesian Computation, by comparing Hyper Suprime-Cam deep field images with simulations which include a forward model of instrumental, observational and source extraction effects. We developed an emulator trained on image simulations using a normalizing flow. We use it to accelerate the inference by predicting detection probabilities, including blending effects and photometric properties of each object, while accounting for background and PSF variations. This enables robustness tests for all elements of the forward model and the inference. The model demonstrates excellent performance when comparing photometric properties from simulations with observed imaging data for key parameters such as magnitudes, colors and sizes. The redshift distribution of simulated galaxies agrees well with high-precision photometric redshifts in the COSMOS field within $1.5sigma$ for all magnitude cuts. Additionally, we demonstrate how GalSBI’s redshifts can be utilized for splitting galaxy catalogs into tomographic bins, highlighting its potential for current and upcoming surveys. GalSBI is fully open-source, with the accompanying Python package, $texttt{galsbi}$, offering an easy interface to quickly generate realistic, survey-independent galaxy catalogs.}

For imaging surveys, this is usually done using photometric redshifts estimated on an object-by-object basis. We present a new approach for directly measuring the global $n(z)$ of cosmological galaxy samples, including uncertainties, using forward modeling. Our method relies on image simulations produced using UFig (Ultra Fast Image Generator) and on ABC (Approximate Bayesian Computation) within the $MCCL$ (Monte-Carlo Control Loops) framework. The galaxy population is modeled using parametric forms for the luminosity functions, spectral energy distributions, sizes and radial profiles of both blue and red galaxies. We apply exactly the same analysis to the real data and to the simulated images, which also include instrumental and observational effects. By adjusting the parameters of the simulations, we derive a set of acceptable models that are statistically consistent with the data. We then apply the same cuts to the simulations that were used to construct the target galaxy sample in the real data. The redshifts of the galaxies in the resulting simulated samples yield a set of $n(z)$ distributions for the acceptable models. We demonstrate the method by determining $n(z)$ for a cosmic shear like galaxy sample from the 4-band Subaru Suprime-Cam data in the COSMOS field. We also complement this imaging data with a spectroscopic calibration sample from the VVDS survey. We compare our resulting posterior $n(z)$ distributions to the one derived from photometric redshifts estimated using 36 photometric bands in COSMOS and find good agreement. This offers good prospects for applying our approach to current and future large imaging surveys.}

	abstractnote = {Modeling the Point Spread Function (PSF) of wide-field surveys is vital for many astrophysical applications and cosmological probes including weak gravitational lensing. The PSF smears the image of any recorded object and therefore needs to be taken into account when inferring properties of galaxies from astronomical images. In the case of cosmic shear, the PSF is one of the dominant sources of systematic errors and must be treated carefully to avoid biases in cosmological parameters. Recently, forward modeling approaches to calibrate shear measurements within the Monte-Carlo Control Loops ($MCCL$) framework have been developed. These methods typically require simulating a large amount of wide-field images, thus, the simulations need to be very fast yet have realistic properties in key features such as the PSF pattern. Hence, such forward modeling approaches require a very flexible PSF model, which is quick to evaluate and whose parameters can be estimated reliably from survey data. We present a PSF model that meets these requirements based on a fast deep-learning method to estimate its free parameters. We demonstrate our approach on publicly available SDSS data. We extract the most important features of the SDSS sample via principal component analysis. Next, we construct our model based on perturbations of a fixed base profile, ensuring that it captures these features. We then train a Convolutional Neural Network to estimate the free parameters of the model from noisy images of the PSF. This allows us to render a model image of each star, which we compare to the SDSS stars to evaluate the performance of our method. We find that our approach is able to accurately reproduce the SDSS PSF at the pixel level, which, due to the speed of both the model evaluation and the parameter estimation, offers good prospects for incorporating our method into the $MCCL$ framework.}

In this work, we propose a novel technique to forward model wide-field broad-band galaxy surveys using the fast image simulator UFig and measure the LF of galaxies in the B-band. We use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to constrain the galaxy population model parameters of the simulations and match data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). We define a number of distance metrics between the simulated and the survey data. By exploring the parameter space of the galaxy population model through ABC to find the set of parameters that minimize these distance metrics, we obtain constraints on the LFs of blue and red galaxies as a function of redshift. We find that M* fades by Δ M*0.1−1.0,b = 0.68 ± 0.52 and Δ M*0.1−1.0,r = 0.54 ± 0.48 magnitudes between redshift z = 1 and z = 0.1 for blue and red galaxies, respectively. We also find that ϕ* for blue galaxies stays roughly constant between redshift z = 0.1 and z=1, while for red galaxies it decreases of ∼ 35%. We compare our results to other measurements, finding good agreement at all redshifts, for both blue and red galaxies. To further test our results, we compare the redshift distributions for survey and simulated data. We use the spectroscopic redshift distribution from the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) and we apply the same selection in colours and magnitudes on our simulations. We find a good agreement between the survey and the simulated redshift distributions. We provide best-fit values and uncertainties for the parameters of the LF.

In this work, we forward-model the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS) narrow-band data. The aim is to improve the constraints on the spectral coefficients used to create the galaxy spectral energy distributions (SED) of the galaxy population model in Tortorelli et al. 2020. In that work, the model parameters were inferred from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) data using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). This led to stringent constraints on the B-band galaxy luminosity function parameters, but left the spectral coefficients only broadly constrained. To address that, we perform an ABC inference using CFHTLS and PAUS data. This is the first time our approach combining forward-modelling and ABC is applied simultaneously to multiple datasets. We test the results of the ABC inference by comparing the narrow-band magnitudes of the observed and simulated galaxies using Principal Component Analysis, finding a very good agreement. Furthermore, we prove the scientific potential of the constrained galaxy population model to provide realistic stellar population properties by measuring them with the SED fitting code CIGALE. We use CFHTLS broad-band and PAUS narrow-band photometry for a flux-limited (i < 22.5) sample of galaxies up to redshift z ∼ 0.8. We find that properties like stellar masses, star-formation rates, mass-weighted stellar ages and metallicities are in agreement within errors between observations and simulations. Overall, this work shows the ability of our galaxy population model to correctly forward-model a complex dataset such as PAUS and the ability to reproduce the diversity of galaxy properties at the redshift range spanned by CFHTLS and PAUS.},

	abstractnote = {Weak lensing by large-scale structure is a powerful probe of cosmology and of the dark universe. This cosmic shear technique relies on the accurate measurement of the shapes and redshifts of background galaxies and requires precise control of systematic errors. The Monte Carlo Control Loops (MCCL) is a forward modelling method designed to tackle this problem. It relies on the Ultra Fast Image Generator (UFig) to produce simulated images tuned to match the target data statistically, followed by calibrations and tolerance loops. We present the first end-to-end application of this method, on the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 wide field imaging data. We simultaneously measure the shear power spectrum $C_{ell}$ and the redshift distribution $n(z)$ of the background galaxy sample. The method includes maps of the systematic sources, Point Spread Function (PSF), an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) inference of the simulation model parameters, a shear calibration scheme, and the fast estimation of the covariance matrix. We find a close statistical agreement between the simulations and the DES Y1 data using an array of diagnostics. In a non-tomographic setting, we derive a set of $C_ell$ and $n(z)$ curves that encode the cosmic shear measurement, as well as the systematic uncertainty. Following a blinding scheme, we measure the combination of $Omega_m$, $sigma_8$, and intrinsic alignment amplitude $A_{rm{IA}}$, defined as $S_8D_{rm{IA}} = sigma_8(Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}D_{rm{IA}}$, where $D_{rm{IA}}=1-0.11(A_{rm{IA}}-1)$. We find $S_8D_{rm{IA}}=0.895^{+0.054}_{-0.039}$, where systematics are at the level of roughly 60% of the statistical errors. We discuss these results in the context of earlier cosmic shear analyses of the DES Y1 data. Our findings indicate that this method and its fast runtime offer good prospects for cosmic shear measurements with future wide-field surveys.},

In a forward modelling approach, the redshift distribution n(z) of a galaxy sample is measured using a parametric galaxy population model constrained by observations. We use a model that captures the redshift evolution of the galaxy luminosity functions, colours, and morphology, for red and blue samples. We constrain this model via simulation-based inference, using factorized Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) at the image level. We apply this framework to HSC deep field images, complemented with photometric redshifts from COSMOS2020. The simulated telescope images include realistic observational and instrumental effects. By applying the same processing and selection to real data and simulations, we obtain a sample of n(z) distributions from the ABC posterior. The photometric properties of the simulated galaxies are in good agreement with those from the real data, including magnitude, colour and redshift joint distributions. We compare the posterior n(z) from our simulations to the COSMOS2020 redshift distributions obtained via template fitting photometric data spanning the wavelength range from UV to IR. We mitigate sample variance in COSMOS by applying a reweighting technique. We thus obtain a good agreement between the simulated and observed redshift distributions, with a difference in the mean at the 1$sigma$ level up to a magnitude of 24 in the i band. We discuss how our forward model can be applied to current and future surveys and be further extended.

The code uses a consistency relation of the field equations to adapt the time step and does not rely on physical approximations for speed-up.

We then compare the predictions and performance of the code for the computation of the transfer functions of cosmological perturbations and compare it to existing cosmological Boltzmann codes. While PyCosmo does not yet have all the features of other codes, our approach is complementary to other fast cosmological Boltzmann solvers and can be used as an independent test of their numerical solutions. The symbolic representation of the Einstein–Boltzmann equation system in PyCosmo provides a convenient interface for implementing extended cosmological models.

We investigate the impact of redshift errors and their interplay with different IA models. Generally, errors on the mean $delta_z$ and on the width $sigma_z$ of the redshift bins can both lead to biases in cosmological constraints. We find that such biases can, however, only be partially resolved by marginalizing over $delta_z$ and $sigma_z$. For Stage-III surveys, $delta_z$ and $sigma_z$ cannot be well constrained due to limited statistics. The resulting biases are thus sensitive to prior volume effects. For Stage-IV surveys, we observe that marginalizing over the redshift parameters has an impact and reduces the bias. We derive requirements on the uncertainty of $sigma_z$ and $delta_z$ for both Stage-III and Stage-IV surveys. We assume that the redshift systematic errors on $S_8$ should be less than half of the statistical errors, and the median bias should be smaller than $0.25sigma$. We find that the uncertainty on $delta_z$ has to be $lesssim0.025$ for the NLA IA model with a Stage-III survey. For $sigma_z$, the requirement is met even for large uncertainties $leq0.3$. For the TATT IA model, the uncertainty on $delta_z$ has to be $lesssim0.02$ and the uncertainty on $sigma_z$ has to be $lesssim0.2$. For Stage-IV surveys, the uncertainty on $delta_z$ has to be $lesssim0.005$ and the uncertainty on $sigma_z$ should be $lesssim0.1$, with no significant dependence on the IA model. This required high precision will be a challenge for the redshift calibration of these future surveys. Finally, we investigate whether the interplay between redshift systematics and IA modelling can explain the $S_8$-tension between cosmic shear results and CMB measurements. We find that this is unlikely to explain the current $S_8$-tension.}

	abstractnote = {In classical cosmological analysis of large-scale structure surveys with two-point functions, the parameter measurement precision is limited by several key degeneracies within the cosmology and astrophysics sectors. For cosmic shear, clustering amplitude σ8 and matter density Ωm roughly follow the S8=σ8(Ωm/0.3 )0.5 relation. In turn, S8 is highly correlated with the intrinsic galaxy alignment amplitude AIA. For galaxy clustering, the bias bg is degenerate with both σ8 and Ωm, as well as the stochasticity rg. Moreover, the redshift evolution of intrinsic alignment (IA) and bias can cause further parameter confusion. A tomographic two-point probe combination can partially lift these degeneracies. In this work we demonstrate that a deep-learning analysis of combined probes of weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering, which we call DeepLSS, can effectively break these degeneracies and yield significantly more precise constraints on σ8, Ωm, AIA, bg, rg, and IA redshift evolution parameter ηIA. In a simulated forecast for a stage-III survey, we find that the most significant gains are in the IA sector: the precision of AIA is increased by approximately 8 times and is almost perfectly decorrelated from S8. Galaxy bias bg is improved by 1.5 times, stochasticity rg by 3 times, and the redshift evolution ηIA and ηb by 1.6 times. Breaking these degeneracies leads to a significant gain in constraining power for σ8 and Ωm, with the figure of merit improved by 15 times. We give an intuitive explanation for the origin of this information gain using sensitivity maps. These results indicate that the fully numerical, map-based forward-modeling approach to cosmological inference with machine learning may play an important role in upcoming large-scale structure surveys. We discuss perspectives and challenges in its practical deployment for a full survey analysis.}

We compare redshift distributions, photometric and physical properties to observations and to GalSBI. GalSBI-SPS reproduces the observed grizy magnitude, colour, and size distributions down to i<23. Median differences in magnitudes and colours remain below 0.14 mag, with the model covering the full colour space spanned by HSC. Galaxy sizes are offset by 0.2 arcsec on average and some tension exists in the g-r colour, but the latter is comparable to that seen in GalSBI. Redshift distributions show a mild positive offset (0.01-0.08) in the mean. GalSBI-SPS qualitatively reproduces the stellar mass-SFR and size-stellar mass relations seen in COSMOS2020. GalSBI-SPS provides a realistic, survey-independent galaxy population description at a Stage-III depth using only parameters from the literature. Its predictive power will improve significantly when constrained against observed data using SBI, providing accurate redshift distributions satisfying the stringent requirements set by Stage IV surveys.}

We also do not explore the impact of non-solar element ratios in our simulations. For a quantitative comparison, we perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the sets of spectra. By comparing the PCs constructed from simulations and data, we find good agreement for all components. The distributions of the eigencoefficients also show an appreciable overlap. We are therefore able to properly simulate the LRG sample taking into account the SDSS/BOSS instrumental responses.

		Abstract

		A forward modelling approach provides simple, fast and realistic simulations of galaxy surveys, without a complex underlying model. For this purpose, galaxy clustering needs to be simulated accurately, both for the usage of clustering as its own probe and to control systematics. We present a forward model to simulate galaxy surveys, where we extend the Ultra-Fast Image Generator to include galaxy clustering. We use the distribution functions of the galaxy properties, derived from a forward model adjusted to observations. This population model jointly describes the luminosity functions, sizes, ellipticities, SEDs and apparent magnitudes. To simulate the positions of galaxies, we then use a two-parameter relation between galaxies and halos with Subhalo Abundance Matching (SHAM). We simulate the halos and subhalos using the fast PINOCCHIO code, and a method to extract the surviving subhalos from the merger history. Our simulations contain a red and a blue galaxy population, for which we build a SHAM model based on star formation quenching. For central galaxies, mass quenching is controlled with the parameter M limit , with blue galaxies residing in smaller halos. For satellite galaxies, environmental quenching is implemented with the parameter t quench , where blue galaxies occupy only recently merged subhalos. We build and test our model by comparing to imaging data from the Dark Energy Survey Year 1. To ensure completeness in our simulations, we consider the brightest galaxies with i < 20. We find statistical agreement between our simulations and the data for two-point correlation functions on medium to large scales. Our model provides constraints on the two SHAM parameters M limit and t quench and offers great prospects for the quick generation of galaxy mock catalogues, optimized to agree with observations.

		Weak Gravitational Lensing is a powerful probe of the dark sector of the
		Universe. One of the main challenges for this technique is the treatment of
		systematics in the measurement of cosmic shear from galaxy shapes. In an
		earlier work, [1] have proposed the Monte Carlo Control Loops (MCCL) to
		overcome these effects using a forward modeling approach. We focus here on
		one of the control loops in this method, the task of which is the calibration
		of the shear measurement. For this purpose, we first consider the
		requirements on the shear systematics for a given survey and propagate them
		to different systematics terms. We use two one-point statistics to calibrate
		the shear measurement and six further one-point statistics as diagnostics. We
		also propagate the systematics levels that we estimate from the one-point
		functions to the two-point functions for the different systematic error
		sources. This allows us to assess the consistency between the systematics
		levels measured in different ways. To test the method, we construct synthetic
		sky surveys with an area of 1,700°2. With some simplifying assumptions, we
		are able to meet the requirements on the shear calibration for this survey
		configuration. Furthermore, we account for the total residual shear
		systematics in terms of the contributing sources. We discuss how this
		framework can be applied within analyses of current and future weak lensing
		surveys.

		We present a forward-modeling simulation framework designed to model the data

		the cosmological simulations (the Blind Cosmology Challenge), we generate
		simulated images (the Ultra Fast Image Simulator) and catalogs representative
		of the DES data. In this work we demonstrate the framework by simulating the
		244 deg2 coadd images and catalogs in five bands for the DES Science
		Verification data. The simulation output is compared with the corresponding
		data to show that major characteristics of the images and catalogs can be
		captured. We also point out several directions of future improvements. Two
		practical examples—star-galaxy classification and proximity effects on object
		detection—are then used to illustrate how one can use the simulations to
		address systematics issues in data analysis. With clear understanding of the
		simplifications in our model, we show that one can use the simulations
		side-by-side with data products to interpret the measurements. This forward
		modeling approach is generally applicable for other upcoming and future
		surveys. It provides a powerful tool for systematics studies that is
		sufficiently realistic and highly controllable.

		Abstract

		We present pop-cosmos : a comprehensive model characterizing the galaxy population, calibrated to 140,938 ( r < 25 selected) galaxies from the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) with photometry in 26 bands from the ultraviolet to the infrared. We construct a detailed forward model for the COSMOS data, comprising: a population model describing the joint distribution of galaxy characteristics and its evolution (parameterized by a flexible score-based diffusion model); a state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis model connecting galaxies’ intrinsic properties to their photometry; and a data model for the observation, calibration, and selection processes. By minimizing the optimal transport distance between synthetic and real data, we are able to jointly fit the population and data models, leading to robustly calibrated population-level inferences that account for parameter degeneracies, photometric noise and calibration, and selection. We present a number of key predictions from our model of interest for cosmology and galaxy evolution, including the mass function and redshift distribution; the mass–metallicity-redshift and fundamental metallicity relations; the star-forming sequence; the relation between dust attenuation and stellar mass, star formation rate, and attenuation-law index; and the relation between gas-ionization and star formation. Our model encodes a comprehensive picture of galaxy evolution that faithfully predicts galaxy colors across a broad redshift ( z < 4) and wavelength range.

This model specifies a prior distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters using a score-based diffusion model, and includes a data model with detailed treatment of nebular emission. We use a GPU-accelerated affine invariant ensemble sampler to achieve fast posterior sampling under this model for 292,300 individual galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog, leveraging a neural network emulator (Speculator) to speed up the SPS calculations. We apply both the pop-cosmos population model and a baseline prior inspired by Prospector-$alpha$, and compare these results to published COSMOS2020 redshift estimates from the widely-used EAZY and LePhare codes. For the $sim 12,000$ galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, we find that pop-cosmos yields redshift estimates that have minimal bias ($sim10^{-4}$), high accuracy ($sigma_text{MAD}=7times10^{-3}$), and a low outlier rate ($1.6%$). We show that the pop-cosmos population model generalizes well to galaxies fainter than its $r<25$ mag training set. The sample we have analyzed is $gtrsim3times$ larger than has previously been possible via posterior sampling with a full SPS model, with average throughput of 15 GPU-sec per galaxy under the pop-cosmos prior, and 0.6 GPU-sec per galaxy under the Prospector prior. This paves the way for principled modeling of the huge catalogs expected from upcoming Stage IV galaxy surveys.}

Unlike the traditional approach of first analyzing individual galaxies and then combining the results to determine the physical properties of the entire galaxy population, we directly make the population distribution the inference objective. We train normalizing flows to approximate the population distribution by minimizing the Wasserstein distance between the synthetic photometry of the galaxy population and the observed data. We validate our method using mock observations and apply it to galaxies from the GAMA survey. PopSED reliably recovers the redshift and stellar mass distribution of $10^{5}$ galaxies using broadband photometry within $<1$ GPU hr, being $10^{5-6}$ times faster than the traditional spectral energy distribution modeling method. From the population posterior, we also recover the star-forming main sequence for GAMA galaxies at $z<0.1$. With the unprecedented number of galaxies in upcoming surveys, our method offers an efficient tool for studying galaxy evolution and deriving redshift distributions for cosmological analyses.}
