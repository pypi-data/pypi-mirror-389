    "# **PIBS** - Permutational Invariance Block Solver\n",
    "PIBS provides a highly efficient numerical method to calculate exact dynamics for models of many identical spins interacting with a common bosonic mode that have a certain weak $\\text{U}(1)$ symmetry, whereby terms in the Liouvillian create or destroy at most one excitation. For such models, in the presence of non-unitary processes describing _only_ loss (or gain), the dynamics of blocks of states of fixed excitation number can be solved sequentially, starting from the highest (or lowest) block. This simplification is in addition to working in the permutation symmetric basis for the spins, which already provides a combinatoric reduction of the size of the problem to be solved.\n",

For example, the element $\\langle 0,\\downarrow\\uparrow|\\rho|1,\\downarrow\\uparrow\\rangle$ is in the block with $\\nu=1, \\nu'=2$.
