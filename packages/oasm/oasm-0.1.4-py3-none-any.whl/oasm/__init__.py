class table(list):
    """
    A flexible container that combines list and dictionary functionality.
    
    The table class extends the built-in list type while adding dictionary-like
    attribute access. This hybrid design allows for both sequential access by index
    and named access by attribute/key.
    
    Key features:
    - Supports list operations (append, extend, indexing)
    - Supports dictionary-like attribute and key access
    - Methods for deep copying and conversion to/from dictionaries
    - Callable interface that supports custom functions or method chaining
    
    Examples:
        t = table(1, 2, 3, a=4, b=5)
        print(t[0])  # Output: 1
        print(t.a)   # Output: 4

        2. Stores all keyword arguments as attributes in the instance dictionary

                a special class marker key (__ClassName__) if it represents a table subclass.

                a class marker, or the original dictionary otherwise.
                
        The reconstruction process:
        1. Checks for known table-derived classes in a predefined set
        2. Searches for a special class marker in the dictionary
        3. If found, extracts the list items, removes the marker, and instantiates
           the appropriate class with the list items and remaining dictionary attributes
        4. If no class marker is found, returns the original dictionary
        
        This method works as the complement to to_dict, allowing serialized

        This method handles attribute access for the expression system, with special behavior for:
        1. Special methods and attributes (starting with '_'): Returns None to avoid conflicts
        2. Known special method names: Returns None for methods like 'compute', 'getdoc', etc.
        3. Regular attribute access: Extends the expression chain by calling self[key]
            
        This allows for elegant expression building with attribute chaining while avoiding
        conflicts with Python's internal methods and handling special method cases appropriately.

                that shows the expression's structure and components.
                
        The representation depends on the expression's content:
        - Empty expressions return 'expr()'
        - Symbolic expressions (starting with None) begin with 'sym'
        - Regular expressions begin with 'expr(value)'
        - String components are appended with dot notation (e.g., '.attribute')
        - Table components are appended as function calls (e.g., '(args)')
        - Other components are appended as index access (e.g., '[index]')
        
        This method helps with debugging and visualization of complex expressions
        by creating a clear textual representation of the expression chain.

            The result of evaluating the expression chain
            
        This method evaluates the expression by processing each element in the expression chain:
        1. Starts with the initial value (first element of the chain)
        2. For each subsequent element in the chain:
           - Evaluates any nested expressions in the current element
           - Applies the appropriate operation based on the element type:
             - If string: Performs attribute access
             - If table: Performs function call with arguments from the table
             - Otherwise: Performs item/index access
        3. Handles self-referential expressions through the 'self' attribute
        4. Provides error recovery by converting exceptions into new expression nodes when appropriate
        
        The evaluation process supports complex nested expressions and maintains proper context for
        expressions that reference themselves through the 'self' attribute.

    - Properly propagates unary minus through nested expressions
    - Maintains symbolic structure for non-numeric operations

    """Domain-specific language (DSL) decorator for custom assembly language constructs.
    
    This decorator enables the creation of domain-specific assembly languages by transforming
    function source code through AST manipulation. It provides a framework for customizing
    and extending assembly-like syntax for specific hardware or application domains.
    
    Args:
        ctx (dict, optional): Context dictionary containing variables and symbols available
            in the DSL environment. Defaults to empty dict.
        regq (callable, optional): Register query function used to identify and process
            register references in the DSL code. If provided, triggers the WithPass AST
            transformation.
        sub (bool/callable, optional): AST transformation option:
            - True: Apply SubPass transformation with the provided context
            - ast.NodeTransformer instance: Apply custom transformer class with context
            - callable: Apply custom callable transformation directly to the AST
            - None: No substitution transformation (default)
        dump (bool, optional): If True and regq is provided, prints the unparsed transformed
            AST for debugging purposes. Defaults to False.
    
    Returns:
        callable: A decorator that transforms the decorated function's source code via AST
            manipulation and returns a wrapper that executes the transformed code in the
            augmented environment.
    
    Process flow:
        1. Extracts the source code of the decorated function
        2. Normalizes indentation to process the code correctly
        3. Parses the code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
        4. Removes existing decorators from the AST
        5. Applies specified AST transformations (substitution and/or register query)
        6. Compiles the transformed AST into executable code
        7. Creates a wrapped function that executes in the augmented environment
    
    This decorator is particularly useful for creating hardware-specific assembly languages,
    instruction set simulators, and domain-specific compilation passes within the oasm framework.
