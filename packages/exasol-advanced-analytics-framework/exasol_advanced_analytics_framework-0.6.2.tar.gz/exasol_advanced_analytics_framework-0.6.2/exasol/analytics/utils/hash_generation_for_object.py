    This function generates a hash value for the object using either the objects __hash__ method,
    or by inspecting it, if it is a list or dict. For non-hashable objects it returns 0.
    It uses the already_seen set to detect potential cycles. However, as a side effect
    it only counts an object once, also if it finds it a second time in another branch.
    This should be not a problem, here, because for computing the hash of an object
    we only need the set of child objects.
