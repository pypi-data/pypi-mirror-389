Assetic ESRI integration SDK
============================
This package provides tools that can be used to assist with integration between Assetic and ESRI.  The tools may be included in the ArcMap python add-in, or in scripts run outside of the ArcMap desktop environment



**Changelog**

**Release 1.3.0.4**
    *   Compatability fix for intermediate CRS transform in ArcMap

**Release 1.3.0.3**
    *   Added an optional parameter to the asset create and update processes to allows transforming layer spatial geometry to an intermediate CRS

**Release 1.3.0.2**
    *   Added alternative method for getting layer fields to support enterprise geodatabase layer connections

**Release 1.3.0.1**
    *   Added boolean parameter for creation of Functional Location when checking for it's existence during asset association

**Release 1.3.0.0**
    *   Added support for Component and Dimension 'upsert' where the Component and or Dimension is created as
        part of the Asset update if the Component/Dimension does not already exist.
        Requires Assetic SDK 2023.16.1.2 minimum, and configuration setting to enable

**Release 1.2.1.1**
    *   Resolve release issue

**Release 1.2.1.0**
    *   Fixed an issue when creating assets where domain lookups for Subtype Field were not resolved, resulting in the create applying the "CodedValue" for domain attributes

**Release 1.2.0.10**
    *   Fixed an issue when writing the asset Id value back to the layer attributes when using a "CodedValue" domain and resolving lookups
    *   Fixed an issue when updating assets where domain lookups were not resolved, resulting in the update applying the "CodedValue" for domain attributes
    *   Fixed an issue where the component type was set to an incorrect value if the type was defined by an attribute field, rather than a default

**Release 1.2.0.9**
    *   Support subtypes where the domain is of type "CodedValue" and the description value is needed rather than
        the code value which is the default.
        To use set <resolve_lookups>True</resolve_lookups> in config for the layer
    *   Cater for data with M dimension (strip null M from upload to Assetic)

**Release 1.2.0.8**
    *   Standardise functional location creation

**Release 1.2.0.7**
    *   Correct error with support for table only layers

**Release 1.2.0.6**
    *   Improve unhandled exception logging by ensuring exception still output to stderr as well as logger
    *   Support legacy use of deprecated CommonTools.force_use_arcpy_addmessage
    *   Improve messaging around testing of Functional Location existence prior to creation

**Release 1.2.0.5**
    *   Moved create/update methods from python-sdk in to this package

**Release 1.2.0.4**
    *   Fixed logging issues
    *   Moved bulk_update_spatial method from python-sdk to assetic-esri-sdk

**Release 1.2.0.3**
    *   Moved common GIS functionality to shared Assetic Python SDK (pypi: assetic)

**Release 1.2.0.2**
    *   Fix issue where functional location not created if type defined by
        an attribute field rather than a default

**Release 1.2.0.1**
    *   Fix issue where spatial upload was skipped in some circumstances

**Release 1.2.0.0**
    *   Introduced support for layers with no spatial data, i.e. tables
    *   Allow for updating components of the same type by including
        component name when obtaining the component to update
    *   Ensure log level is correctly set

**Release 1.1.3.2**
    *   Improve messaging if missing configuration

**Release 1.1.3.1**
    *   Cater for partial asset creation whereby the asset is created
        but a component, dimension, or functional location association
        fails.  Reported as a partial success, and the GIS is updated
        with the asset Id and optionally the component ID if created
    *   Requires the assetic python package 2020.6.1.1 as a minimum

**Release 1.1.2.1**
    *   Support configuration where id not a functional location field
    *   Improve messaging around missing configurations

**Release 1.1.2.0**
    *   Add option to apply custom calculation script that allows
        fields from layer to be used to derive new fields to be used for
        input to Assetic.  The derived field does not need to be in the layer

**Release 1.1.1.1**
    *   Add XML configuration option to set threshold at which bulk
        update occurs via Data Exchange rather than per asset

**Release 1.1.1.0**
    *   Introduced support for creating and updating Functional Location for a Functional Location layer
    *   Introduced support for associating an asset with a Functional Location on asset creation or update
    *   Introduced bulk update process where feature count exceeds 250.
        Data Exchange is used to apply the updates as it is a more
        efficient process for large volume updates.

**Release 1.0.1.14**
    *   Fix issue caused by missing bracket in version check

**Release 1.0.1.13**
    *   Check the Assetic folder exists in %APPDATA% and if not create it

**Release 1.0.1.12**
    *   When initiating the settings in the xml configuration file will be
        used in preference to the passed in logfile name and level
    *   Prior to initialisation of the logging, unhandled errors will be
        written to %APPDATA%/assetic/addin.log

**Release 1.0.1.10**
    *   Cater for multiple network measure addition records against a
        single component provided the shape differs for each

**Release 1.0.1.9**
    *   Cater for arcs/circles in polygon and polyline definitions
    *   Add arcpy Progressor option for progress messages when using
        model builder

**Release 1.0.1.8**
    *   On asset creation the status did not match the layer configuration

**Release 1.0.1.7**
    *   Add support for creating and updating Component, Dimension and Address, standardise spatial upload.
    *   Improve error logging to catch unhandled exceptions
    *   Minimum required Assetic package is 2019.2.3.0

**Release 1.0.1.6**
    *	Correct potential issue with unsupported spatial data upload

**Release 1.0.1.5**
    *	Add property config.force_use_arcpy_addmessage as boolean.
        If using Model Builder in ArcMap it ensures messages are written to the	Model Builder run dialog rather than a separate
        pop-up dialog that can get lost behind the Model Builder dialog.  Default = False

**Release 1.0.1.4**
    *	Allow a filter to be provided on asset creation
    *	Correct issue with setting log file

**Release 1.0.1.1**
    *	Publish to pypi
