---

The [planetary-coverage](https://docs.planetary-coverage.org)
package is a toolbox to perform surface coverage analysis based on orbital trajectory calculations.
Its main intent is to provide an easy way to compute observation
opportunities of specific region of interest above the Galilean
satellites for the ESA-Juice mission but could be extended in the
future to other space mission.

It is actively developed by the
[Observatoire des Sciences de l'Univers Nantes Atlantique](https://osuna.univ-nantes.fr)
(OSUNA, CNRS-UAR 3281) and the
[Laboratory of Planetology and Geosciences](https://lpg-umr6112.fr)
(LPG, CNRS-UMR 6112) at Nantes University (France), under
[ESA-Juice](https://sci.esa.int/web/juice) and [CNES](https://cnes.fr) founding support.

📦 Installation
---------------

The package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/planetary-coverage/) and can be installed very easily:

- If you are in a [`Jupyter environnement`](https://jupyter.org/), you can use the magic command `%pip` in a notebook cell and ▶️ `Run` it:
```bash
%pip install planetary-coverage
```

- or, if you are using a `terminal environment`, you can do:
```bash
pip install planetary-coverage
```

> __Note:__ If you plan to use this package with Juice and you want to enable [PTR simulation with AGM](https://esa-ptr.readthedocs.io/).
> You can add a `juice` extra parameter in the `pip` install command: `pip install planetary-coverage[juice]`


The package is also available on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/planetary-coverage)
and you can install it with `conda`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge planetary-coverage
```
