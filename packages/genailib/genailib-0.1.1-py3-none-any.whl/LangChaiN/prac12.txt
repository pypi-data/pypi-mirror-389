### 🧠 **Theory: Building a Simple Autonomous AI Agent and Multi-Agent Interaction**

1. **Autonomous AI Agent**

   * An autonomous agent is an AI system capable of making decisions or generating responses on its own without continuous human input.
   * It uses a **language model** (like GPT) to understand prompts and produce relevant text outputs.
   * Example: A chatbot that can answer questions or continue a conversation logically.

2. **Multi-Agent Interaction**

   * This involves **multiple AI agents** communicating or collaborating with each other.
   * Each agent receives the other’s response as input, simulating dialogue or problem-solving.
   * It demonstrates how AI systems can **exchange information, reason collectively, or debate** ideas.

3. **Key Components**

   * **Language Models**: Pre-trained transformers (e.g., GPT-2) that generate human-like text.
   * **Context Management**: Maintaining conversation flow between agents.
   * **Autonomy**: Each agent acts based on its own model output rather than external rules.

4. **Applications**

   * AI assistants cooperating on tasks (e.g., summarization + reasoning).
   * Simulation of debates, negotiations, or brainstorming between virtual agents.
   * Research in **AI collaboration, communication, and emergent behavior**.

5. **Conclusion**

   * This experiment shows how multiple generative models can form the basis of autonomous multi-agent systems.
   * Such systems are the foundation for **AI societies, decision-making simulations, and human-AI teamwork** in complex tasks.
