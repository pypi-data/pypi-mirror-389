## 🧠 **Prompt Engineering for Text Summarization & Question Answering**

### 🔹 **1. What is Prompt Engineering?**

Prompt engineering means **designing effective input prompts** to guide large language models (LLMs) toward producing better, context-aware, and accurate outputs.
A well-crafted prompt helps models understand *what* is being asked and *how* to respond.

---

### 🔹 **2. Text Summarization**

* The **summarization pipeline** uses a pre-trained model (here: `facebook/bart-large-cnn`) to condense long text into a concise summary.
* The **prompt** provides explicit instruction — e.g.,
  `"Summarize the following text clearly and concisely:"`
  This improves the model’s understanding of style and length expectations.
* The model encodes the text → extracts key ideas → generates a shorter version.

🧩 **Example:**

> Prompt: “Summarize the following text clearly and concisely…”
> Output: Short, human-readable summary.

### 🔹 **3. Question Answering (QA)**

* The **QA pipeline** (here: `distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad`) takes a *context paragraph* and a *question*.
* It uses **transformer-based attention** to locate the most relevant span of text that answers the question.
* Prompt formulation (“When was the Eiffel Tower completed?”) ensures precision.

🧩 **Process:**

1. Encode both the context and question.
2. Model predicts the start and end positions of the answer.
3. Decodes and returns the text span.

### 🔹 **4. Why Prompt Engineering Matters**

* Prompts control **tone, clarity, and relevance**.
* Helps models **generalize better** without fine-tuning.
* Makes pre-trained models useful for downstream tasks (like summarization or QA).

### 🧾 **In Short:**

| Task          | Model Used                                | Prompt Role              | Output          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------- |
| Summarization | `facebook/bart-large-cnn`                 | Guides clarity & brevity | Concise summary |
| QA            | `distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad` | Directs question focus   | Exact answer    |
