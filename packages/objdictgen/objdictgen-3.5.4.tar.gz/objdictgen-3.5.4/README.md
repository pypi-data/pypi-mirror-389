# Objdictgen (`odg`)

This is python tools for working with Object Dictionary (OD) files for
the CanFestival communication library. CanFestival is an open source
implementation of the [CANopen](https://www.can-cia.org/canopen/)
communication protocol.

This repo is located:

objdictgen includes tools to generate c code that works in tandem with a
canfestival library. This tool has been built to work together with the
Laerdal Medical fork for the canfestival library:

objdictgen is a tool to parse, view and manipulate files containing object
dictionary (OD). An object dictionary is entries with data and configuration
in CANopen devices. The `odg` executable is installed. It supports
reading and writing OD files in `.json`/`.jsonc` format, in legacy XML `.od`
and `.eds` files. It can generate c code for use with the canfestival library.


## Install

To use this package Python3 must be installed. Use the package manager of
choice to install the package in a virtual manager. We recommend
the [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

Using uv (one of many methods)

    $ uv venv
    $ uv pip install objdictgen[ui]  # [ui] will install GUI tools
    $ uv run odg

Using pip (for Windows)

    $ py -3 -mvenv venv
    $ venv/Scripts/pip install objdictgen[ui]

After this `venv/Scripts/odg.exe` (on Windows) or `venv\bin\odg` executable
exists and can be called directly to run the command.

The `objdictgen[ui]` suffix will install the wx dependency needed for the UI
`odg edit`. If no UI is needed, this suffix can be omitted.


## `odg` command-line tool

`odg` is a command-line tool which is installed when the python package
`objdictgen` is installed.

Invocation:

    $ odg <options>
    $ python -mobjdictgen <options>   # <-- If odg is unavailable

`odg --help` and `odg <command> --help` exists and shows the command options.
The most useful commands are:

    $ odg list <od-files...>              # List contents of the OD
    $ odg convert <od-file1> <od-file2>   # Convert OD file
    $ odg convert <od-file> <c-file>      # Convert OD to c code
    $ odg diff <od-file1> <od-file2>      # Show differences between OD


### Legacy commands

The legacy commands `objdictgen` and `objdictedit` are no longer available. The
commands are available under `odg gen` and `odg edit` respectively.


## JSON schema

[src/objdictgen/schema/od.schema.json](src/objdictgen/schema/od.schema.json)
provides a JSON schema for the JSON OD format. This can be used for validation
in editors.

To use the schema in **VS Code**, the following configuration must be added to
your `settings.json`. After this is is installed, IntelliSense will show field
descriptions, help with values and validate the file.

```json
    "json.schemas": [
      {
        "fileMatch": [
          "**.jsonc"
        ],
        "url": "./src/objdictgen/schema/od.schema.json"
      }
    ],
```

## Conversion

The recommended way to convert existing/legacy `.od` files to the new JSON
format is:

    $ odg generate <file.od> <file.jsonc> --fix --drop-unused [--nosort]

The `--fix` option might be necessary if the OD-file contains internal
inconsistencies. It is safe to run this option as it will not delete any active
parameters. The `--drop-unused` will remove any unused *profile* and *DS-302*
parameter that might be used in the file.


## Motivation

The biggest improvement with the new tool over the original implementation is
the introduction of a new `.jsonc` based format to store the object dictionary.
The JSON format is well-known and easy to read. The tool use jsonc,
allowing comments in the json file. `odg` will process the file in a repeatable
manner, making it possible support diffing of the `.jsonc` file output. `odg`
remains 100% compatible with the legacy `.od` format on both input and output.

The original objdictedit and objdictgen tool were written in legacy python 2 and
and this is a port to python 3.

This tool is a fork from upstream canfestival-3-asc repo:

## Making objdictedit excutable

To be able build an executable that can be run from anywhere:

    $ pip install pyinstaller
    $ pyinstaller packaging/objdictedit.spec

The file `dist/objdictedit.exe` can now be used anywhere. It does not need any
pre-installed software.
