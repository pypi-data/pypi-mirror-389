# Utilities Agents Guide

Supporting helpers shared by ConfigManager and sources.

- `merge.py`: deep merge logic; confirm new merge behaviour through tests before changing.
- `paths.py`: path expansion helpers; keep platform-safe and side-effect free.

When adding utilities, document consumers here so coordination is obvious.
