### Requirements Files

The project uses separate requirements files for different purposes:

## Usage

Here is an example of how to use the project:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from flowrules.rules_engine import policy, rule, Policy

@dataclass
class Request:
    id: int
    notional: float
    client: str
    
@policy(policy_id="P01", policy_name="InitialRequestValidation")
class InitialRequestPolicy(Policy):
    @rule(rule_id="R001", rule_name="Validate notional", failure_message="The notional is too high.")
    def validate_notional(self, r: Request):
        return r.notional < 100000
    
    @rule(rule_id="R002", rule_name="Validate client", failure_message="The client is unknown.")
    def validate_client(self, r: Request):
        return r.client in ["client1", "client2"]
  

policy = InitialRequestPolicy()
result = policy.execute(Request(id=1, notional=90000, client="client1"))
print(result)
```

You can find more examples in the `examples/` directory.
