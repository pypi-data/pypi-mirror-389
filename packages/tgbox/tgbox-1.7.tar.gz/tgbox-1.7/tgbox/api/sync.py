"""
This (slightly changed module & its features) was taken from the Telethon
library made by Lonami under MIT License: github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon

Parts of this file i moved to the tgbox.api.utils package module, check
the out _syncify_wrap_func() and syncify functions. They are NOT mine.

Thanks to the Lonami. See part of the original description:

--->
This magical module will rewrite all public methods in the public interface
of the library so they can run the loop on their own if it's not already
running. This rewrite may not be desirable if the end user always uses the
methods they way they should be ran, but it's incredibly useful for quick
scripts and the runtime overhead is relatively low.<---

All you should do is to firstly import this module, then anything you want.

    This will make async generator to sync

    sync code (to load *only* local files):

        ... # Some code was omitted

        To sync coroutines you can use a ``sync`` func
        from the tgbox package (`tgbox.sync`) or use

# example, after 'import tgbox.api.sync' the functions
# or classes in __init__.py (get_box, Box, etc) will
# stay the same, but in 'api' they will be synced.

# from tgbox.api import get_box <-- Will stay Async
# from tgbox.api.abstract import get_box <-- Will become Sync

# This is a strange behaviour and below we fix it by
# updating __dict__ of the __init__.py with synced
# versions of classes/functions. A bit quirky way,
