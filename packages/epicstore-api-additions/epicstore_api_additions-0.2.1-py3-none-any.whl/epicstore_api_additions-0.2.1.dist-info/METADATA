An unofficial library to work with Epic Games Store Web API.
**The library works with `cloudscraper` under the hood to battle the anti-bot protections, please be careful with the amount of requests you do, as this is not a silver bullet.**

## About This Fork

This is a customized fork of the original `epicstore_api` library with additional features and improvements:

- Added `get_store_config()` method to retrieve store configuration for products by sandbox ID
- Added `get_product_by_id()` method to retrieve product details by product ID
- Added `get_product_offer_by_id()` method to retrieve offer details by product ID and offer ID
- Implemented support for persisted GraphQL queries with hash caching mechanism
- Added configurable hash endpoint for fetching GraphQL operation hashes
- Enhanced performance with caching for sha256Hash values
- Improved error handling and flexibility for API interactions

## Installing

**Python 3.7 or higher is required**

To install the library you can just run the following command:

``` sh
# Linux/macOS
python3 -m pip install -U epicstore_api_additions

# Windows
py -3 -m pip install -U epicstore_api_additions
```


### Quick Example

``` py
api = EpicGamesStoreAPI()
namespace, slug = next(iter(api.get_product_mapping().items()))
first_product = api.get_product(slug)
offers = [
    OfferData(page['namespace'], page['offer']['id'])
    for page in first_product['pages']
    if page.get('offer') and 'id' in page['offer']
]
offers_data = api.get_offers_data(*offers)
for offer_data in offers_data:
    data = offer_data['data']['Catalog']['catalogOffer']
    developer_name = ''
    for custom_attribute in data['customAttributes']:
        if custom_attribute['key'] == 'developerName':
            developer_name = custom_attribute['value']
    print('Offer ID:', data['id'], '\nDeveloper Name:', developer_name)
```

### New Feature: Get Store Configuration

```python
from epicstore_api import EpicGamesStoreAPI

# Initialize API
api = EpicGamesStoreAPI(locale="zh-CN")

# Get store configuration for a product by sandbox ID
sandbox_id = "b4bb52a95d0b43d9af543c6ec3c54e04"  # Example sandbox ID
config = api.get_store_config(sandbox_id)
print(config)
```

### New Feature: Get Product by ID

```python
from epicstore_api import EpicGamesStoreAPI

# Initialize API
api = EpicGamesStoreAPI(locale="zh-CN", country="TW")

# Get product details by product ID
product_id = "3ac65ef5cdf44b8084fcac818002635f"  # Example product ID
product = api.get_product_by_id(product_id)
print(product)
```

### New Feature: Get Product Offer by ID

```python
from epicstore_api import EpicGamesStoreAPI

# Initialize API
api = EpicGamesStoreAPI(locale="zh-CN", country="TW")

# Get offer details by product ID and offer ID
product_id = "3ac65ef5cdf44b8084fcac818002635f"  # Example product ID
offer_id = "cb49140c3c11429589ab22fd75c41504"  # Example offer ID
offer = api.get_product_offer_by_id(product_id, offer_id)
print(offer)
```
