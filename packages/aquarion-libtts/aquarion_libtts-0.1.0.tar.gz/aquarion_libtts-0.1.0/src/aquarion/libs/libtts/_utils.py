    This is useful for when i18n message definition and it's actual translation are done
    at different times.  E.g. defined at import or class definition time, but actually
    translated at runtime.

    Example usage:

    from aquarion.libs.libtts._utils import fake_gettext as _

    class_var = _("some text")


    Naming this function as _() will cause Babel to extract the text to the message
    template, but actual translation would have to be done later with something like

    return _(class_var)

    where _() in this case is the real gettext.
