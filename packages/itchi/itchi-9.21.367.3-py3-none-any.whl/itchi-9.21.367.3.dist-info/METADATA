# iTCHi Developer Readme

iTCHi is a helper tool closely tied to TASKING's [winIDEA](https://www.tasking.com/products/winidea).

## Setup IDE

To work on iTCHi using Visual Studio Code, you can use the provided workspace 
`itchi.code-workspace`.

If you are planning to use PyCharm, nothing special has to be done, just specify the correct venv and
you are good to go. Note that there are no pre-made PyCharm run configurations, but tests can be
executed directly.

## Setup Virtual Environment

You can use an existing venv or, even better, create a brand-new venv for this project.
Using a separate venv will ensure that there is no clashing of packages, and all necessary 
requirements are specified in this project, making it self-contained.

Make sure that you are using the most recent version of Python that is used in TASKING 
development.

Creating a venv can be done using:

`<path to python interpreter> -m venv <desired venv location>`

To use this venv, we need to **activate it**. The location of the activate script is OS dependent.
On Linux it is `source <venv root dir>/bin/activate` and
on Windows `<venv root dir>/Scripts/activate.<ps1, bat, ...>`.

Once the venv is activated for the first time, it is recommended to upgrade pip by running
`python -m pip install --upgrade pip`.

## Install the iTCHi Package

Once the venv is created, you need to install the iTCHi package. If you plan to modify iTCHi sources,
make sure that you install iTCHi in editable mode using the `-e` flag for pip.

Installing iTCHi is simple:

- Activate venv
- Make sure that the `ISYSTEM_APPS` environment variable is configured
- Navigate into the iTCHi root directory (where `pyproject.toml` is located)
- install it using `python -m pip install -e .` to install it in editable mode.
- if a wheel should be created, call `python -m pip wheel --no-deps .`

  Note that in case that you want actual version stored in \_\_version\_\_, 
  you have to define `WINIDEA_BUILD_VERSION` environmental variable, 
  prior to building wheels.


## Launching iTCHi

Once the iTCHi package is installed in the venv, you can launch it using `python -m itchi.itchi_cli`
or call `itchi-cli<.exe>` directly, since pip created an executable and added it to the PATH
on venv activation. Because you installed iTCHi in venv, you can call this command from anywhere
when the iTCHi venv is active.

There is also a GUI version `itchi-gui`, which imports the CLI version under the hood.

## Tests

All tests are located in the `tests` directory. If new tests are created, make sure that you are not 
importing the iTCHi components relative to the tests, but rather import them as installed packages 
(no leading dots should be present in the imports!). This will ensure that the tests are testing 
what will be deployed and not what is in editable mode.

If some custom files are needed, specify them relative to the test file, for example:

```py
import os
file_of_interest = os.path.normpath(
    os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'file_of_interest.png')
)
```

This will ensure that tests can be executed from arbitrary locations, and you do not need to change 
the current working directory.

Run `pytest .` in the itchi/tests directory to execute all tests. See the pytest manual for more info 
on how to execute them.

## Adding a New Command

To add a new command, make sure to add it at the following locations:

1. The command parser in `src/itchi/itchi_cli.py`
2. The launch configuration in `itchi.code-workspace` (for easier development)
3. The regression tests in `examples/test_examples`
4. The documentation in `docs/readme.md`
