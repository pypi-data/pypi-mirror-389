              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## 📖 Overview

**Surya** (Sanskrit for "Sun") is a 366M-parameter foundation model for heliophysics, trained on full-resolution multi-instrument SDO observations (AIA & HMI). It learns general-purpose solar representations through spatiotemporal transformers, enabling state-of-the-art performance in solar flare forecasting, active region segmentation, solar wind prediction, and EUV spectra modeling.


### Key Features

- **Multi-instrument Learning**: Trained on 13 channels from SDO's AIA (8 channels) and HMI (5 channels) instruments
- **Full Resolution**: Native 4096×4096 pixel resolution with 12-minute cadence
- **Novel Architecture**: Spatiotemporal transformer with spectral gating and long-short range attention
- **Zero-shot Capabilities**: Forecasts solar dynamics and flare events without additional training
- **Versatile Fine-tuning**: Parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation for diverse downstream tasks

### What Makes Surya Special?

Unlike traditional task-specific models, Surya learns physics-aware representations that generalize across multiple solar phenomena:

- **Solar Flare Forecasting**
- **Active Region Segmentation**
- **Solar Wind Prediction**
- **EUV Spectra Modeling**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended)
- [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended)

### 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/Surya.git
cd Surya
```

2. **Install uv package manager (optional)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

3. **Set up the environment**
```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 🧪 Verify Installation

Run the end-to-end test to ensure everything is working:

```bash
python -m pytest -s -o log_cli=true tests/test_surya.py
```

This will:
- Download the pretrained model and test data
- Generate 2-hour ahead forecasts for 2014-01-07
- Create a validation visualization (`surya_model_validation.png`)
- Verify model inference

Expected output:
```
============================= test session starts ==============================

```bash
# Step 1: Run pytest to download the model and verify dependencies
python -m pytest -s -o log_cli=true tests/test_surya.py  

# Step 2: Navigate to the downstream examples
cd downstream_examples/

# Step 3: Download the sample dataset
python download_data.py
```


### 1. Solar Flare Forecasting

Predict M-class and X-class solar flares up to 24 hours in advance.

```bash
cd downstream_examples/solar_flare_forcasting
python3 download_data.sh
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=1 --standalone finetune.py
```

### 2. Active Region Segmentation

Segment solar active regions and polarity inversion lines from magnetograms.

```bash

## 📥 Data and Model Access

### Pretrained Models

The Surya foundation model and datasets are available on HuggingFace 🤗 :

- **Model Repository**: [`nasa-ibm-ai4science/Surya-1.0`](https://huggingface.co/nasa-ibm-ai4science/Surya-1.0)
- **Dataset Repository**: [`nasa-ibm-ai4science/core-sdo`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nasa-ibm-ai4science/core-sdo)

### SDO Data Download

For downstream applications, download the preprocessed SDO data:

```bash
cd downstream_examples
python download_data.py
```

This will:
1. Download data from HuggingFace repository
2. Extract and organize validation/test datasets  
3. Generate CSV index files for each downstream task
4. Set up data in the expected directory structure


## 📊 Model Architecture

Surya employs a novel spatiotemporal transformer architecture optimized for solar dynamics:

### Core Components

1. **Spectral Gating Blocks** (2 layers)
   - Frequency-domain filtering with learnable complex weights
   - Adaptive re-weighting of spectral components
   - Noise suppression and feature enhancement

2. **Long-Short Attention Blocks** (8 layers) 
   - **Local attention**: Fine-scale dependencies within spatial windows
   - **Global attention**: Long-range correlations via dynamic projection
   - Multi-scale representation learning

3. **Decoder Block**
   - Lightweight projection back to physical domain
   - Maintains spatial structure and channel relationships

### Training Strategy

- **Phase 1**: One-step ahead forecasting (160k steps, 128 GPUs)
- **Phase 2**: Autoregressive rollout tuning (2-5 hour horizons)
- **Objective**: Mean Squared Error with signum-log normalization
- **Data**: 2011-2019 SDO observations (~257TB processed)


### Data Processing Pipeline

Our preprocessing ensures ML-ready, physics-consistent data:

- **Temporal alignment**: 12-minute cadence across all instruments
- **Spatial registration**: Uniform 0.6"/pixel grid, solar north alignment
- **Calibration**: Instrument degradation correction, exposure normalization
- **Quality control**: Automated flagging and filtering
