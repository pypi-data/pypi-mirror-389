"""Exception classes for genro-storage.

All exceptions inherit from StorageError base class for easy catching.
Exceptions also inherit from standard Python exceptions where appropriate
to maintain compatibility with existing code.
"""


class StorageError(Exception):
    """Base exception for all storage-related errors.
    
    This is the base class that all genro-storage exceptions inherit from.
    You can catch this to handle any storage-related error.
    
    Examples:
        >>> try:
        ...     node.read_bytes()
        ... except StorageError as e:
        ...     print(f"Storage error occurred: {e}")
    """
    pass


class StorageNotFoundError(StorageError, FileNotFoundError):
    """Raised when a file, directory, or mount point is not found.
    
    This exception inherits from both StorageError and FileNotFoundError,
    so it can be caught by either exception type.
    
    Common causes:
        - Attempting to access a mount point that hasn't been configured
        - Reading a file that doesn't exist
        - Accessing a path in a non-existent directory
    
    Examples:
        >>> try:
        ...     node = storage.node('missing_mount:file.txt')
        ... except StorageNotFoundError:
        ...     print("Mount or file not found")
    """

class StoragePermissionError(StorageError, PermissionError):
    """Raised when a permission-related error occurs.
    
    This exception inherits from both StorageError and PermissionError,
    so it can be caught by either exception type.
    
    Common causes:
        - Insufficient permissions to read/write a file
        - Insufficient AWS/GCS/Azure credentials or permissions
        - Attempting to write to a read-only storage backend (e.g., HTTP)
    
    Examples:
        >>> try:
        ...     node.write_bytes(b'data')
        ... except StoragePermissionError:
        ...     print("Permission denied")
    """
    pass


class StorageConfigError(StorageError, ValueError):
    """Raised when configuration is invalid.
    
    This exception inherits from both StorageError and ValueError,
    so it can be caught by either exception type.
    
    Common causes:
        - Invalid configuration format (missing required fields)
        - Unsupported storage backend type
        - Invalid path format
        - Malformed YAML/JSON configuration file
    
    Examples:
        >>> try:
        ...     storage.configure([{'name': 'test'}])  # missing 'type'
        ... except StorageConfigError as e:
        ...     print(f"Configuration error: {e}")
