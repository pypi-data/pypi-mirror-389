This module allows to select a At shipping invoicing mode for a
customer. It is based on partner_invoicing_mode. When this mode is
selected the customer will be invoiced automatically on delivery of the
goods.

Another option is the 'One Invoice Per Shipping'. That one is not
compatible with the 'At shipping' invoicing mode. In that case, the
invoicing validation will occur at a different moment (monthly, ...).
