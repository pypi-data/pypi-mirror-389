# PanopticML

Default plugin for panoptic, provides all machine learning functionalities such as:
- image embeddings using OpenAI CLIP
- images clustering using FAISS Kmeans or HDBScan
- images to images similarity using FAISS Index L2
- text to images similarity using FAISS Index L2 + CLIP

## Available models

Several models are available in this plugin to compute the embeddings: 
- [google mobilenet](https://huggingface.co/google/mobilenet_v2_1.4_224): a really light model with lower performances but made to run on bad devices, no support for text similarity
- [openAI CLIP](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14): default model for panoptic, good performances, runs well on most computers with a decent CPU, support text similarity and has a good understanding of semantics
- [meta dinosV2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/dinov2): model that will have better performances than CLIP on pure visual similarities but less understanding of themes and semantics, no support for text similarity, runs well on CPU
- [google SIGLIP2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/siglip2): computing heavy model, NVDIA GPU recommended but works also on CPU (it will take a long time to compute embeddings), way better results than CLIP on text similarity and semantics, and pretty good visual features
- auto transformers: want to tryout any huggingface multimodal model ? you can just provide its id to panopticML and should be able to use it directly

## Clustering functions
- Kmeans: specify a number of clusters, really fast
- HDBScan: automatic number of clusters, a bit slower and excludes a lot of images
- Images to text: considering several texts, create a cluster per text and put each image to the text it is the closest to
- Find duplicates: create clusters with only images sharing a lot of similarity together, good to find duplicates or near duplicates
