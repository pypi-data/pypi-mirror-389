    This is a base class for `ExecutingRun` and `ExecutingTask` classes.
    The `ExecutingRun` and `ExecutingTask` classes are returned by methods
    in `Runner` and `NBRunner`, and they are subclasses of this class.
    
    The `ExecutingRun` class for instance contains a reference to a `metaflow.Run`
    object representing the currently executing or finished run, as well as the metadata
    related to the process.
    
    Similarly, the `ExecutingTask` class contains a reference to a `metaflow.Task`
    object representing the currently executing or finished task, as well as the metadata
    related to the process.
    
    This class or its subclasses are not meant to be instantiated directly. The class
    works as a context manager, allowing you to use a pattern like:
    
    ```python
    with Runner(...).run() as running:
        ...

    Note that you should use either this object as the context manager or `Runner`, not both
