        ----------
        path : Optional[Union[str, os.PathLike]], default: None
            The path to save the checkpoint. Accepts a file path or a directory path.
                - If a directory path is provided, all the contents within that directory will be saved.
                When a checkpoint is reloaded during task retries, `the current.checkpoint.directory` will
                contain the contents of this directory.
                - If a file path is provided, the file will be directly saved to the datastore (with the same filename).

        name : Optional[str], default: "mfchckpt"
            The name of the checkpoint.
        
        metadata : Optional[Dict], default: {}
            Any metadata that needs to be saved with the checkpoint.
        
        latest : bool, default: True
            If True, the checkpoint will be marked as the latest checkpoint.
            This helps determine if the checkpoint gets loaded when the task restarts.
        
        storage_format : str, default: files
            If `tar`, the contents of the directory will be tarred before saving to the datastore.

        lists the checkpoints in the current task or the specified task.
        
        When users call `list` without any arguments, it will list all the checkpoints in the currently executing
        task (this includes all attempts). If the `list` method is called without any arguments outside a Metaflow Task execution context,
        it will raise an exception. Users can also call `list` with `attempt` argument to list all checkpoints within a

        When a `task` argument is provided, the `list` method will return all the checkpoints

        If the `Task` object contains a `DataArtifact` with all the previous checkpoints, then the `list` method will return

        Usage:
        ------

        Parameters
        ----------

        task : Optional[Union["metaflow.Task", str]], default: None
            The task to list checkpoints from. Can be either a `Task` object or a task pathspec string.
            If None, lists checkpoints for the current task.
            Raises an exception if task is not provided when called outside a Metaflow Task execution context.
        
        attempt : Optional[Union[int, str]], default: None
            Filter checkpoints by attempt.
            If `task` is not None and `attempt` is None, then it will load the task's latest attempt
        
        full_namespace : bool, default: False
            If True, lists checkpoints from the full namespace.
            Only allowed during a Metaflow Task execution context.

def merge_dicts_with_precedence(*args: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Merges multiple dictionaries, respecting the order of precedence.
    
    This function takes any number of dictionary arguments and merges them into a single dictionary.
    If the same key exists in multiple dictionaries, the value from the dictionary that appears
    last in the argument list takes precedence, except where the value is None, in which case
    the search continues in the earlier dictionaries for a non-None value.
    
    The operation is not recursive and will only consider top-level keys.
    
    Parameters:
    - args: A variable number of dictionary arguments. Each argument must be a dictionary.
    
    Returns:
    - dict: A single dictionary that results from merging the input dictionaries according to their order of precedence.
    
    Examples:
    - merge_dicts_with_precedence(defaults, attrs)
      Here, `defaults` is a dictionary of default values, and `attrs` contains override values.
      Any None values in `attrs` will result in values from `defaults` being used.
    
    - merge_dicts_with_precedence(defaults, global_config, attrs)
      In this scenario, `global_config` can override `defaults`, and `attrs` can override both
      `defaults` and `global_config`. The order of arguments defines the precedence.
    
    Note:
    The function behaves differently if the order of the arguments changes, reflecting the
    precedence of the values set based on their position in the argument list.

    @retry(times=3)
    @checkpoint
    @step
    def train(self):
        # Assume that the task has restarted and the previous attempt of the task

        for i in range(self.epochs):
            ...
    ```
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    load_policy : str, default: "fresh"
        The policy for loading the checkpoint. The following policies are supported:
            - "eager": Loads the the latest available checkpoint within the namespace.
            With this mode, the latest checkpoint written by any previous task (can be even a different run) of the step
            will be loaded at the start of the task.
            - "none": Do not load any checkpoint
            - "fresh": Loads the lastest checkpoint created within the running Task.
            This mode helps loading checkpoints across various retry attempts of the same task.
            With this mode, no checkpoint will be loaded at the start of a task but any checkpoints
            created within the task will be loaded when the task is retries execution on failure.
    
    temp_dir_root : str, default: None
        The root directory under which `current.checkpoint.directory` will be created.
    
    
    MF Add To Current
    -----------------
    checkpoint -> metaflow_extensions.obcheckpoint.plugins.machine_learning_utilities.checkpoints.decorator.CurrentCheckpointer
        The `@checkpoint` decorator makes saving/loading checkpoints available through the `current.checkpoint`.
        The object exposes `save`/`load`/`list` methods for saving/loading checkpoints.
    
        You can check if a checkpoint is loaded by `current.checkpoint.is_loaded` and get the checkpoint information
        by using `current.checkpoint.info`. The `current.checkpoint.directory` returns the path to the checkpoint directory
        where the checkpoint maybe loaded or saved.
