About
########

Build123d is a Python-based, parametric (BREP) modeling framework for 2D and 3D CAD. 
Built on the Open Cascade geometric kernel, it provides a clean, fully Pythonic interface 
for creating precise models suitable for 3D printing, CNC machining, laser cutting, and 
other manufacturing processes. Models can be exported to popular CAD tools such as FreeCAD 
and SolidWorks.

Designed for modern, maintainable CAD-as-code, build123d combines clear architecture with 
expressive, algebraic modeling. It offers:

* Minimal or no internal state depending on mode
* Explicit 1D, 2D, and 3D geometry classes with well-defined operations
* Extensibility through subclassing and functional composition—no monkey patching
* Standards-compliant code (PEP 8, mypy, pylint) with rich pylance type hints
* Deep Python integration—selectors as lists, locations as iterables, and natural 
  conversions (``Solid(shell)``, ``tuple(Vector)``)
* Operator-driven modeling (``obj += sub_obj``, ``Plane.XZ * Pos(X=5) * Rectangle(1, 1)``) 
  for algebraic, readable, and composable design logic

The result is a framework that feels native to Python while providing the full power of 
OpenCascade geometry underneath.


With build123d, intricate parametric models can be created in just a few lines of readable 
Python code—as demonstrated by the tea cup example below.
