        GEONE is a python package providing a set of tools for geostatistical
        and multiple-point statistics modeling. It contains the DEESSE library
        in the sub-package deesse_core.
        
        DEESSE is a commercial product which is not provided as an open source
        software and belongs to the University of Neuchâtel. GEONE includes a
        wrapper allowing to launch DEESSE directly in python.
        
        GEONE is provided as an open source code with an open access license
        applicable for all the code except the deesse_core subpackage (see
        details below).
        
        DEESSE and therefore the deesse_core subpackage requires a specific
        license agreement for commercial use only.  The use of  DEESSE is free
        (royalty free) and unlimited for academic research and teaching
        activities. Its use for industrial and commercial activities is
        authorized only under a specific license agreement to be concluded
        with the University of Neuchâtel. Such commercial license must be
        obtained before any commercial or industrial use to take place and
        fees will be charged. To obtain such a commercial license from the
        University of Neuchâtel, the users shall contact directly Prof.
        Philippe Renard (philippe.renard@unine.ch).

# GEONE

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/geone/badge/?version=latest)](https://geone.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

**Current version : 1.3.0** <!-- Update manually here! see src/geone/_version.py -->

GEONE is a Python3 package providing a set of tools for geostatistical modeling, including:

- multiple-point statistics (MPS) simulation as "DEESSE wrapper"
- geostatistical tools based on two-point statistics, including  "GEOSCLASSIC wrapper"
- miscellaneous algorithms based on random processes

## Documentation, examples and references

The documentation of GEONE is on https://geone.readthedocs.io.

<!-- The notebooks (examples) from the documentation are available in [docs/source/notebooks](./docs/source/notebooks). -->
The notebooks (examples) from the documentation are available in [docs/source/notebooks](https://github.com/randlab/geone/tree/master/docs/source/notebooks).

## Installation

GEONE is available on:

- [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/geone) (The Python Package Index)
- [Github repository](https://github.com/randlab/geone)

GEONE relies on pre-compiled C libraries (DEESSE and GEOSCLASSIC core), available for:
- linux (x86_64 with GLIBC 2.35 or GLIBC 2.27) and python 3.9 to 3.13
- mac (x86_64 or arm64) and python 3.9 to 3.13
- windows and python 3.9 to 3.13

### Installation from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/geone)

In a terminal type
```
pip install geone
```
Or, equivalently: `python -m pip install geone`.

### Installation from the [Github repository](https://github.com/randlab/geone)

In a terminal, change directory where to download GEONE, and type
```
git clone https://github.com/randlab/geone.git
cd geone
pip install .
```

*Note:* use `pip install . --verbose` or `pip install . -v` for printing (more) messages during the installation.

Alternatively:

- Instead of `git clone ...`, you can download GEONE from the [Github repository](https://github.com/randlab/geone): click on the green button "code" and choose "Download ZIP".
- Then, unzip the archive on your computer
- Finally, in a terminal, go into the unzipped directory, and type `pip install .`

**Warning - Using GEONE**

If the installation has been done from github, do not launch python from the directory containing the downloaded sources and where the installation has been done (with `pip`), otherwise `import geone` will fail.

### Requirements

The following python packages are used by GEONE:

- `matplotlib`
- `multiprocessing` (for parallel processes)
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `pyvista`
- `scipy`

**Note: `numpy` version >= 2 is used.**

**Remark: the package `ipykernel` is required to run the notebooks.**

GEONE has been tested with the following settings:
```
platform_system : Linux
python version  : sys.version_info(major=3, minor=13, micro=7, releaselevel='final', serial=0)
glibc_str       : glibc 2.35
glibc_version   : (2, 35)
machine         : x86_64
matplotlib.__version__ = 3.10.7
numpy.__version__      = 2.3.3
pandas.__version__     = 2.3.3
pyvista.__version__    = 0.46.3
scipy.__version__      = 1.16.2
```

### Removing GEONE
In a terminal type

`pip uninstall -y geone`

*Note: First remove the directory 'geone.egg-info' from the current directory (if present).*
