Text encoding type classifier.

</div>

`whatenc` is a command-line tool that uses a gradient-boosted tree classifier to detect the encoding of a given string or file.

The model is trained on text samples from the English, Greek, Russian, Hebrew, and Arabic Wikipedia corpora, chosen to represent a diverse set of writing systems (Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic scripts). Each line is encoded using multiple encoding schemes to generate labeled examples.

## How It Works

`whatenc` applies a feature-based approach to characterize text, then feeds these features into a gradient-boosted decision tree model to classify the encoding.

### Feature Extraction

Each input string is converted into a feature vector describing its statistical properties.

Features include:

| Feature | Description |
| :------ | :---------- |
| Length (`n`) | Number of characters in the input |
| `n % 4` | Useful for identifying base-N encodings |
| Printable Ratio | Fraction of characters in `string.printable` |
| Alphabetic / Digit Ratios | Ratio of letters and digits to total length |
| Padding Ratio (`=`) | Common in Base64/32 encodings |
| Compressibility | Ratio of compressed to raw byte length |
| Shannon Entropy | Measure of randomness in character distribution |
| English Letter Correlation | Correlation between letter frequencies and English letter frequency distribution |
| Stopword Ratio | Fraction of English stopwords | 

### Supported Encodings

`whatenc` currently recognizes the following formats and transformations:

| Category | Encodings |
| :------- | :-------- |
| Base encodings | `base32`, `base64`, `base85`, `hex`, `url` |
| Text ciphers | `morse` |
| Compression | `gzip64` |
| Hash digests | `md5`, `sha1`, `sha224`, `sha256`, `sha384`, `sha512` |

## Installation

You can install `whatenc` using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx):

```bash
pipx install whatenc
```

## Usage

```bash
whatenc hello
whatenc samples.txt
```

### Examples

```bash
[+] input: ZW5jb2RlIHRvIGJhc2U2NCBmb3JtYXQ=
   [~] top guess   = base64
      [=] base64   = 0.875
      [=] base32   = 0.101
      [=] gzip64   = 0.019

[+] input: hi
   [~] top guess   = plain
      [=] plain    = 0.772
      [=] base64   = 0.081
      [=] base32   = 0.075

[+] input: bfa99df33b137bc8fb5f5407d7e58da8
   [~] top guess   = md5
      [=] md5      = 1.000
      [=] sha1     = 0.000
      [=] url      = 0.000
```
