## Quick Start

CatLLM helps social scientists and researchers automatically categorize open-ended survey responses, images, and web-scraped data using AI models like GPT-5 and Claude. Not to be confused with CAT-LLM for Chinese article‐style transfer ([Tao et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.05707v1)).

Text Analysis: Simply provide your survey responses and category list - the package handles the rest and outputs clean data ready for statistical analysis. It works with single or multiple categories per response and automatically skips missing data to save API costs.

Image Categorization: Uses the same intelligent categorization method to analyze images, extracting specific features, counting objects, identifying colors, or determining the presence of elements based on your research questions.

Web Data Collection: Builds comprehensive datasets by scraping web data and using Large Language Models to extract exactly the information you need. The function searches across multiple sources, processes the findings through AI models, and structures everything into clean dataframe format ready for export to CSV.

Whether you're working with messy text responses, analyzing visual content, or gathering information from across the web, CatLLM consistently transforms unstructured data into structured categories and datasets you can actually analyze. All outputs are formatted for immediate statistical analysis and can be exported directly to CSV for further research workflows.



## Configuration

### Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. **Create an OpenAI Developer Account**:
   - Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) (separate from regular ChatGPT)
   - Sign up with email, Google, Microsoft, or Apple

2. **Generate an API Key**:
   - Log into your account and click your name in the top right corner
   - Click "View API keys" or navigate to the "API keys" section
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - Give your key a descriptive name
   - Set permissions (choose "All" for full access)

3. **Add Payment Details**:
   - Add a payment method to your OpenAI account
   - Purchase credits (start with $5 - it lasts a long time for most research use)
   - **Important**: Your API key won't work without credits

4. **Save Your Key Securely**:
   - Copy the key immediately (you won't be able to see it again)
   - Store it safely and never share it publicly

5. Copy and paste your key into catllm in the api_key parameter

**Note:** For beta testing, I recommend starting with OpenAI or Anthropic.


## API Reference

### `explore_corpus()`

Extracts categories from a corpus of text responses and returns frequency counts.

**Methodology:**
The function divides the corpus into random chunks to address the probabilistic nature of LLM outputs. By processing multiple chunks and averaging results across many API calls rather than relying on a single call, this approach significantly improves reproducibility and provides more stable categorical frequency estimates.

**Parameters:**
- `survey_question` (str): The survey question being analyzed
- `survey_input` (list): List of text responses to categorize
- `api_key` (str): API key for the LLM service
- `cat_num` (int, default=10): Number of categories to extract in each iteration
- `divisions` (int, default=5): Number of chunks to divide the data into (larger corpora might require larger divisions)

    user_model="gpt-4o",
    creativity=0,
    safety =TRUE,
    api_key="OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

### `image_features()`

Extracts specific features and attributes from images, returning exact answers to user-defined questions (e.g., counts, colors, presence of objects).

**Methodology:**

    features_to_extract=['Spongebob is yellow','Both are smiling','Patrick is chunky']
    image_input= ['desktop/image1.jpg','desktop/image2.jpg', desktop/image3.jpg'], 
    model_source= 'OpenAI',
    user_model="gpt-4o",
    creativity=0,
    safety =TRUE,
    api_key="OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

### `build_web_research_dataset()`

Conducts automated web research on specified topics and compiles the findings into a structured dataset, extracting answers and source URLs for comprehensive research workflows. 

NOTE: This function currently only works with Anthropic models and requires an Anthropic API key. It is strongly recommended to increase your API rate limits before using this function to avoid interruptions during web research tasks.

SECOND NOTE: This function works best if you are specific with your search question. For example, instead of search_question="Hottest temperature in 2024?" you should use "Hottest temperature in 2024 from extremeweatherwatch.com?" or "Hottest temperature in 2024 from weatherundeground.com?". Another example is use "Where these UC Berkeley professors got their PhD according to Linkedin?" instead of "Where they got their PhD according to Linkedin?" to avoid matching people with the same name. 

THIRD NOTE: This function works by scraping data from the web. Be aware that not all websites allow webscraping from Anthropic and therefore the function won't be able to retrieve information from these sites.

**Methodology:**
Performs systematic web searches using the specified search questions and processes the results through Anthropic's language models to extract relevant information. The function handles multiple search queries sequentially, applying time delays between requests to respect rate limits. Results are categorized according to user-defined criteria and can be exported to CSV format for further analysis and research documentation.

**Rate Limits:**
Before using this function, review and increase your Anthropic API rate limits at: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/limits. For general information about API rate limits, consult the Anthropic documentation at: https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/rate-limits

**Parameters:**
- `search_question` (str): Primary research question or topic to guide the search strategy
- `search_input` (list): List of specific search queries or questions to investigate
- `features_to_extract` (list): List of specific features to extract (e.g., ["number of people", "primary color", "contains text"])
- `api_key` (str): API key for the LLM service
- `answer_format`: (str, default="concise"): Response detail level ("concise", "detailed", "comprehensive")
- `additional_instructions` (str, default="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"): Specific Anthropic model to use for processing results
- `user_model` (str, default="gpt-4o"): Specific vision model to use
- `creativity` (float, default=0): Temperature/randomness setting (0.0-1.0)
- `safety` (bool, default=False): Enable safety checks and save results at each API call step
- `filename` (str, default="categorized_data.csv"): Filename for CSV output
- `save_directory` (str, optional): Directory path to save the CSV file
- `model_source` (str, default="OpenAI"): Model provider ("OpenAI", "Anthropic", "Perplexity", "Mistral")
- `time_delay` (int, default=15): Delay in seconds between search requests to manage API rate limits

**Returns:**
- `pandas.DataFrame`: DataFrame with image paths and extracted feature values for each specified attribute[1][4]

**Example:**

```
import catllm as cat          

research_data = cat.build_web_research_dataset(
    search_question="What are the latest developments in renewable energy technology?",
    search_input=["solar panel efficiency 2025", "wind turbine innovations", "battery storage breakthroughs"],
    api_key="ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
    answer_format="detailed",
    additional_instructions="Focus on recent technological advances and commercial applications",
    categories=['Answer', 'URL', 'Date', 'Key_Technology'],
    model_source="Anthropic",
