# Air SQLModel

Right now we have verified this project supports PostgreSQL and SQLite. It is unclear if other databases are supported, but they may be. Please open an issue if you have success or failure with other databases.

## Air plus SQLModel Made Easy!

[SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/) is a wrapper around the venerable and proven SQLAlchemy library. Like Typer, FastAPI, pydantic, and Air, SQLModel allows for definition of critical objects with type annotations - in this case database tables. SQLModel makes SQLAlchemy a bit easier to use, although it's possible to drop down to the raw power of SQLAlchemy at any time.

Using Air's SQL module requires an understanding of SQLModel. 

## Installation

You can install AirSQLModel with UV. Here's how to install it with PostgreSQL support:

```bash
uv add "airsqlmodel[postgresql]"
```

And now for SQLite support:

```bash
uv add "airsqlmodel[sqlite]"
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Currently AirSQLModel only supports PostgreSQL and SQLite. If you try to use another database, submit a pull request or open an issue.

## Configuring Air for SQL

While not strictly required, it's highly recommended to use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to configure your database connection. This is a common convention used by many web frameworks and libraries.

To ensure the database remains connected to Air, we configure a `lifespan` function, and pass that to the Air app upon instantiation. If you don't do this, then the connection will eventually expire and your application will start throwing errors.

So when instantiating your project's root 'app':

```python
import air
import airsqlmodel as sql

app = air.Air(lifespan=sql.async_db_lifespan)
```

## Making SQL Queries inside Air Views

Most of the time, you'll be using SQLModel inside your Air views. The easiest way to do this is to use the `air_sqlmodel.async_session_dependency` dependency, which requires that the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable be set. This will provide you with an asynchronous session connected to your database.

```python title="main.py"
import air
import airsqlmodel as sql
from sqlmodel import select

app = air.Air(lifespan=airsqlmodel.async_db_lifespan)

@app.page
async def index(request: Request, session: sql.AsyncSession = air.Depends(sql.async_session_dependency)):
    # Use the session to interact with the database
    result = await session.execute(select(User).where(User.name == "John"))
    user = result.scalars().first()
    
    return air.Main(
        air.H1("User Info"),
        air.P(f"Name: {user.name}"),
        air.P(f"Email: {user.email}"),
    )
```

## Making SQLModel Queries Outside Air Views

Sometimes you may want to make SQL queries outside of Air views, for example in background tasks or other parts of your application. In these cases, you can use the `airsqlmodel.get_async_session` function to get an asynchronous session.

```python title="tasks.py"
import air
import airsqlmodel as sql
from sqlmodel import select

async def some_background_task():
    async with sql.get_async_session() as session:
        result = await session.execute(select(User).where(User.active == True))
        active_users = result.scalars().all()
        # Do something with active_users
```
