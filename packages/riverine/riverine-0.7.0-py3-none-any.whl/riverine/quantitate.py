"""
A module for handling "quantitation": measuring concentration of strands,
and diluting and hydrating to reach a desired concentration.

The main "easy" functions to use are :func:`hydrate_from_specs` and
:func:`hydrate_and_measure_conc_and_dilute_from_specs`.

>>> from riverine.quantitate import hydrate_from_specs, hydrate_and_measure_conc_and_dilute_from_specs
>>> specs_file = 'path/to/coa.csv'
>>> target_conc_high = '200 uM'
>>> target_conc_low = '100 uM'
>>> hydrate_from_specs(
...     filename=specs_file,
...     target_conc=target_conc_high,
...     strands=['5RF', '3RQ'],
... )
nmoles = 8.9 nmol
nmoles = 15.7 nmol
{'5RF': <Quantity(44.5, 'microliter')>,
 '3RQ': <Quantity(78.5, 'microliter')>}
>>> # now go to the lab and add the above quantities of water/buffer to the dry samples,
>>> # then measure absorbances, e.g., with a NanoDrop, to populate the dict `absorbances` below
>>> absorbances = {
...     '5RF': [48.46, 48.28],
...     '3RQ': [34.36, 34.82],
... }
>>> hydrate_and_measure_conc_and_dilute_from_specs(
...     filename=specs_file,
...     target_conc_high=target_conc_high,
...     target_conc_low=target_conc_low,
...     absorbances=absorbances,
... )
{'5RF': (<Quantity(213.931889, 'micromolar')>, <Quantity(48.4210528, 'microliter')>),
 '3RQ': (<Quantity(190.427429, 'micromolar')>, <Quantity(69.176983, 'microliter')>)}

For convenience in Jupyter notebooks, there are also versions of these functions beginning with ``display_``:
:func:`display_hydrate_from_specs` and :func:`display_hydrate_and_measure_conc_and_dilute_from_specs`.
Instead of returning a dictionary, these methods display the result in the Jupyter notebook,
as nicely-formatted Markdown.

    Assuming :func:`hydrate` is called with parameters `nmol` and `target_conc_high` to give initial
    volumes to add to a dry sample to reach a "high" concentration `target_conc_high`,

    calculates subsequent dilution volumes to reach "low" concentration `target_conc_low`,
    and also actual "start" concentration (i.e., actual concentration after adding initial hydration
    that targeted `target_conc_high`, according to `absorbance`).

    This is on the assumption that the first hydration step could result in a concentration below
    `target_conc_high`, so `target_conc_high` should be chosen sufficiently larger than
    `target_conc_low` so that the actual measured concentration after the first step is
    likely to be above `target_conc_low`, so that it is possible to reach concentration
    `target_conc_low` with a subsequent dilution step. (As opposed to requiring a vacufuge to
    concentrate the sample higher).

    ----------

    nmol:
        number of nmol (nanomoles) of dry product.

    target_conc_low:
        the "real" target concentration that we will try to hit after the second
        addition of water/buffer.

    absorbance:
        UV absorbance at 260 nm. Can either be a single float/int or a nonempty sequence of floats/ints
        representing repeated measurements; if the latter then an average is taken.

    ext_coef:
        Extinction coefficient in L/mol*cm.

    Like :func:`hydrate_and_measure_conc_and_dilute`, but works with multiple strands,
    using an IDT spec file to look up nmoles and extinction coefficients.

    The intended usage of this method is to be used in conjunction with the function
    :func:`hydrate_from_specs` as follows.

    >>> from riverine.quantitate import hydrate_from_specs, hydrate_and_measure_conc_and_dilute_from_specs
    >>> specs_file = 'path/to/coa.csv'
    >>> target_conc_high = '200 uM'
    >>> target_conc_low = '100 uM'
    >>> hydrate_from_specs(
    ...     filename=specs_file,
    ...     target_conc=target_conc_high,
    ...     strands=['5RF', '3RQ'],
    ... )
    nmoles = 8.9 nmol
    nmoles = 15.7 nmol
    {'5RF': <Quantity(44.5, 'microliter')>,
     '3RQ': <Quantity(78.5, 'microliter')>}
    >>> # now go to the lab and add the above quantities of water/buffer to the dry samples,
    >>> # then measure absorbances, e.g., with a NanoDrop, to populate the dict `absorbances` below
    >>> absorbances = {
    ...     '5RF': [48.46, 48.28],
    ...     '3RQ': [34.36, 34.82],
    ... }
    >>> hydrate_and_measure_conc_and_dilute_from_specs(
    ...     filename=specs_file,
    ...     target_conc_high=target_conc_high,
    ...     target_conc_low=target_conc_low,
    ...     absorbances=absorbances,
    ... )
    {'5RF': (<Quantity(213.931889, 'micromolar')>, <Quantity(48.4210528, 'microliter')>),
     '3RQ': (<Quantity(190.427429, 'micromolar')>, <Quantity(69.176983, 'microliter')>)}

    Note in particular that we do not need to specify the volume prior to the dilution step,
    since it is calculated based on the volume necessary for the first hydration step to
    reach concentration `target_conc_high`.

    For convenience in Jupyter notebooks, there are also versions of these functions beginning with
    ``display_``:
    :func:`display_hydrate_from_specs` and :func:`display_hydrate_and_measure_conc_and_dilute_from_specs`.
    Instead of returning a dictionary, these methods display the result in the Jupyter notebook,
    as nicely-formatted Markdown.

    Parameters
    ----------

    filename:
        path to IDT Excel/CSV spreadsheet with specs of strands (e.g., coa.csv)

    target_conc_high:
        target concentration for initial hydration. Should be higher than `target_conc_low`,

    target_conc_low:
        the "real" target concentration that we will try to hit after the second
        addition of water/buffer.

    absorbances:
        UV absorbances at 260 nm. Is a dict mapping each strand name to an "absorbance" as defined
        in the `absobance` parameter of :func:`hydrate_and_measure_conc_and_dilute`.
        In other words the value to which each strand name maps
        can either be a single float/int, or a nonempty sequence of floats/ints
        representing repeated measurements; if the latter then an average is taken.

    vols_removed:
        Total volumes removed from `vol` to measure absorbance;
        is a dict mapping strand names (should be subset of strand names that are keys in `absorbances`).
        Can be None, or can have strictly fewer strand names than in `absorbances`;
        defaults are assumed as explained next for any missing strand name key.
        For example, if two samples were taken, one at 1 µL and one at 1.5 µL, then set
        `vol_removed` = 2.5 µL.
        If not specified, it is assumed that each sample is 1 µL, and that the total number of samples
        taken is the number of entries in `absorbance`.
        If `absorbance` is a single volume (e.g., ``float``, ``int``, ``str``, ``DecimalQuantity``),
        then it is assumed the number of samples is 1 (i.e., `vol_removed` = 1 µL),
        otherwise if `absorbance` is a list, then the length of the list is assumed to be the
        number of samples taken, each at 1 µL.

    enforce_utf8:
        If `filename` is a text CSV file and this paramter is True, it enforces that `filename` is valid
        UTF-8, raising an exception if not. This helps to avoid accidentally dropping Unicode characters
        such as µ, which would silently convert a volume from µL to L.
        If do not want to convert the specs file to UTF-8 and you are certain that no important Unicode
        characters would be dropped, then you can set this parameter to false.

    Returns
    -------
        dict mapping each strand name in keys of `absorbances` to a pair (`conc`, `vol_to_add`),
        where `conc` is the measured concentration according to the absorbance value(s) of that strandm
        and `vol_to_add` is the volume needed to add to reach concentration `target_conc_low`.
