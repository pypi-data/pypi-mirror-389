class Pipeline:
    '''Represents a sequence of steps executed in order, forming a pipeline.

    A pipeline can have zero or more steps. When a pipeline has no steps (empty list), it acts as a
    pass-through pipeline that simply returns the input state unchanged. This is useful when using
    the pipe (|) operator to define RAG State without requiring explicit steps.

    Attributes:
        steps (list[BasePipelineStep]): List of steps to be executed in the pipeline. Can be empty
            for a pass-through pipeline.
        state_type (type): The type of state used in the pipeline. Defaults to RAGState.
        recursion_limit (int): The maximum number of steps allowed.
        name (str | None): A name for this pipeline. Used when this pipeline is included as a subgraph.
            Defaults to None, in which case the name will be "Subgraph" followed by a unique identifier.
        exclusions (ExclusionManager): The exclusion manager for this pipeline.

    Usage examples:
        # Basic pipeline with steps
        ```python
        pipeline = Pipeline([retrieval_step, generation_step, terminator_step])
        ```

        # Empty pipeline (pass-through)
        ```python
        pipeline = Pipeline([])
        pipeline = Pipeline(None)
        ```

        # Pipeline with custom state type
        ```python
        class CustomState(TypedDict):
            user_query: str
            context: str
            response: str

        pipeline = Pipeline([retrieval_step, generation_step], state_type=CustomState)
        ```

        # Named pipeline for subgraph usage
        ```python
        pipeline = Pipeline([retrieval_step, generation_step], name="rag_pipeline")
        ```

        # Pipeline with caching
        ```python
        pipeline = Pipeline(
            [retrieval_step, generation_step],
            cache_store=cache_store,
            cache_config={"ttl": 3600, "name": "rag_cache"}
        )
        ```

        # Using pipe (|) operator to combine steps
        ```python
        pipeline = retrieval_step | generation_step | terminator_step
        ```
        # Using pipe (|) operator to combine step with pipeline
        ```python
        pipeline = Pipeline([retrieval_step, generation_step]) | terminator_step
        ```
        # Using pipe (|) operator to combine pipelines
        ```python
        pipeline1 = Pipeline([retrieval_step])
        pipeline2 = Pipeline([generation_step, terminator_step])
        combined_pipeline = pipeline1 | pipeline2
        ```

        # Configure step exclusion after initialization (set-only)
        ```python
        log_step = log(name="log_step", ...)
        retrieval_step = step(name="retrieval_step", ...)
        generation_step = step(name="generation_step", ...)
        pipeline = Pipeline([log_step, retrieval_step, generation_step])
        pipeline.exclusions.exclude("log_step")  # Skip logging step
        ```

        # Configure composite step exclusion
        ```python
        log_step = log(name="log_step", ...)
        retrieval_a_step = step(name="retrieval_a_step", ...)
        retrieval_b_step = step(name="retrieval_b_step", ...)
        parallel_step = parallel(
            name="parallel_step", {"retrieval_a": retrieval_a_step, "retrieval_b": retrieval_b_step},
        )
        pipeline = Pipeline([log_step, parallel_step])
        pipeline.exclusions.exclude("parallel_step")  # Skip the entire parallel step
        pipeline.exclusions.exclude("parallel_step.retrieval_a")  # Skip retrieval_a step
        pipeline.exclusions.exclude("parallel_step.retrieval_b")  # Skip retrieval_b step
