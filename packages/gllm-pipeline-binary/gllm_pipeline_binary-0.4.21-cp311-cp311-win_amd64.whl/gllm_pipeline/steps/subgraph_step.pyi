    """A pipeline step that executes another pipeline as a subgraph.

    This step allows for encapsulation and reuse of pipeline logic by treating another pipeline as a step.
    The subgraph can have its own state schema, and this step handles the mapping between the parent and
    subgraph states.

    Attributes:
        name (str): A unique identifier for this pipeline step.
        subgraph (Pipeline): The pipeline to be executed as a subgraph.
        input_map (dict[str, str | Val] | None): Unified input map.
        output_state_map (dict[str, str]): Mapping of parent pipeline state keys to subgraph output keys.
