## 📦 Technical Details

### Major Code Changes

**RelayMetadata Complete Rewrite**
```python
# Old v1.0.0 approach (class-based)
class RelayMetadata:
    def __init__(self, relay, generated_at, connection_success, ...):
        # Many individual parameters
        pass

# New v1.1.0 approach (dataclass-based)
@dataclass
class RelayMetadata:
    relay: Relay
    generated_at: int
    nip11: Optional["RelayMetadata.Nip11"] = None
    nip66: Optional["RelayMetadata.Nip66"] = None
```

**Enhanced Exception System**
```python
# New base exception class
class NostrToolsError(Exception):
    """Base exception for all nostr-tools errors."""

# Specific exception types
class RelayConnectionError(NostrToolsError):
    """Exception raised for relay connection errors."""

class EventValidationError(NostrToolsError):
    """Exception raised when event validation fails."""
```

### From v1.0.0

**⚠️ Breaking Changes**

This release includes significant breaking changes to the RelayMetadata API:

**RelayMetadata API Changes**
```python
# v1.0.0 approach (NO LONGER WORKS)
metadata = RelayMetadata(
    relay=relay,
    generated_at=timestamp,
    connection_success=True,
    nip11_success=True,
    openable=True,
    readable=True,
    writable=True,
    rtt_open=100,
    rtt_read=150,
    rtt_write=200,
    name="Relay Name",
    description="Relay Description",
    # ... many more parameters
)

# v1.1.0 approach (NEW)
metadata = RelayMetadata(
    relay=relay,
    generated_at=timestamp,
    nip11=RelayMetadata.Nip11(
        name="Relay Name",
        description="Relay Description",
        # ... NIP-11 specific fields
    ),
    nip66=RelayMetadata.Nip66(
        openable=True,
        readable=True,
        writable=True,
        rtt_open=100,
        rtt_read=150,
        rtt_write=200,
        # ... NIP-66 specific fields
    )
)
```

**Exception Handling Changes**
```python
# v1.0.0 approach
try:
    # ... operations
except Exception as e:
    # Generic exception handling
    pass

# v1.1.0 approach (NEW)
try:
    # ... operations
except NostrToolsError as e:
    # Handle any nostr-tools specific error
    if isinstance(e, RelayConnectionError):
        # Handle connection errors
        pass
    elif isinstance(e, EventValidationError):
        # Handle event validation errors
        pass
    # ... other specific exception types
```

**Test Structure Changes**
```python
# v1.0.0 test files (REMOVED)
# tests/test_basic.py
# tests/test_integration.py
# tests/test_performance.py
# tests/test_security.py

# v1.1.0 test structure (NEW)
