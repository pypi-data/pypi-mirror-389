This library implements as low-level mutable data structure to store a finite relation between finite sets:

    .. math::

        R \subseteq X_1 \times ... \times X_n

It presumes that the *component sets* :math:`X_1,...,X_n` are finite zero-based contiguous integer ranges, in the form :math:`X_j = {0,...,s_j-1}`.
The tuple :math:`(s_1,...,s_n)` of component set sizes is referred to as the *shape* of the relation :math:`R`,
while the tuples :math:`(x_1,...x_n) \in R` are referred to as its *entries*.

Relations are implemented using a 64-bit `roaring bitmaps <http://roaringbitmap.org/>`_. to store the underlying set of entries.
