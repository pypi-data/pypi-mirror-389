# TrackToTrip4
*TrackToTrip4* is a fork of [TrackToTrip3](https://github.com/dserafim1999/tracktotrip3), a Python 3 library used to process, simplify and clean GPS tracks. The original TrackToTrip3 library is no longer maintained, and this fork aims to keep it up to date with the latest Python versions and dependencies, plus adding new features and improvements.

The main goals are to transform a (gpx) **track into a trip**.

> **track**
> raw representation of a GPS recording. It is not precise, has noise and valuable information is hidden.


> **trip**
> result of one or more processed tracks. Its start and end points have semantic meaning, such as home, work or school. It has less errors and it's compressed, with as little information loss as possible. In short, a trip is an approximation of the true path recorded.

## Installing

You can install TrackToTrip4 by running the following command:

```
 $ python setup.py install
```

**NOTE:** TrackToTrip4 requires Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0. It can be found using the [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools)


**Python 3.x** is required.

## Overview

The starting points are the [Track](../master/tracktotrip3/track.py), [Segment](../master/tracktotrip3/segment.py) and [Point](../master/tracktotrip3/point.py) classes.

### [Track](../master/tracktotrip3/track.py)

Can be loaded from a GPX file:

```python
from tracktotrip4 import Track, Segment, Point

track = Track.from_gpx('file_to_track.gpx')
```

A track can be transformed into a trip with the method ` to_trip `. Transforming a track into a trip executes the following steps:

1. Smooths the segments, using the [kalman filter](../master/tracktotrip3/smooth.py)

2. Spatiotemporal segmentation for each segment, using the [DBSCAN algorithm](../master/tracktotrip3/spatiotemporal_segmentation.py) to find spatiotemporal clusters

3. Compresses every segment, using [spatiotemporal-aware compression algorithm](../master/tracktotrip3/compression.py)

A track is composed by ` Segment `s, and each segment by ` Point `s.

It can be saved to a GPX file:

```python
with open('file.gpx', 'w') as f:
  f.write(track.to_gpx())
```

### [Segment](../master/tracktotrip3/segment.py)

A Segment holds the points, the transportation modes used, and the start and end semantic locations.

### [Point](../master/tracktotrip3/point.py)

A Point holds the position and time. Currently the library doesn't support elevation.


## Command line tools

In addition to the library, *TrackToTrip3* offers three command line tools outside of the library to manipulate GPS tracks and to generate classifier.

### tracktotrip_utils

```
usage: tracktotrip_utils.py [-h] [-a] [-s] [-o] [--eps EPS]
                            [--mintime MINTIME] [--seed SEED]
                            track [track ...] output_folder

Manipulate tracks

positional arguments:
  track              track to process, must be a gpx file
  output_folder

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -a, --anonymize    anonymizes tracks, by doing random rotations and
                     translations
  -s, --split        splits tracks so that each file contains a segment
  -o, --organize     takes all tracks and split them, naming them according
                     with their start date
  --eps EPS          max distance to other points. Used when spliting.
                     Defaults to 1.0
  --mintime MINTIME  minimum time required to split, in seconds. Defaults to
                     120
  --seed SEED        random number generator seed. Used when anonymizing
```

### tracktotrip_geolife_dataset

The **GeoLife Tracjectory dataset** can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52367&from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdownloads%2Fb16d359d-d164-469e-9fd4-daa38f2b2e13%2F). The datasetFolder argument should point to the Data folder in the **GeoLife Trajectory dataset** folder.

```
usage: tracktotrip_geolife_dataset.py [-h] [-o outputFolder] [-d]
                                      datasetFolder

GeoLife Trajectory dataset transportation mode extractor. Extracts
transportation mode from the dataset, into individual files, annotated with
the following format: [transporation mode].[control].[nPoints].[original file
name].gpx



positional arguments:
  datasetFolder         Path to the GeoLife dataset folder

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o outputFolder, --output outputFolder
                        Path to processed dataset

```
