Library for COUNTER-compliant detection of machines and robots.

The purpose behind COUNTER is to enable comparable usage statistics by only
reporting genuine user-driven usage for repositories. The purpose behind Code
of Practice for Research Data is to split genuine COUNTER user-driven usage
into human- and machine-based access.

This Python library implements a tiny API to check if a given user agent
string from a browser is considered a robot/crawler/spider or a machine
according to the `Code of Practice for Research Data
<https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.26505v1>`_ [1]  as well as the
`COUNTER Code of Practice
<https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-sections/abstract/>`_.

The library depends on official lists published by both projects. You can see
the lists on:

- `Making Data Count
  <https://github.com/CDLUC3/Make-Data-Count/tree/master/user-agents>`_
- `COUNTER <https://github.com/atmire/COUNTER-Robots/>`_
