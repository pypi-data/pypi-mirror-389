description = This notebook implements the Binary Survivor algorithm for discrete optimization problems. It uses a swarm-based approach to solve binary vector problems, as demonstrated on the OneMax problem where the goal is to maximize the number of 1s in a binary string. The output shows the algorithm successfully found the optimal solution with all 1s.
