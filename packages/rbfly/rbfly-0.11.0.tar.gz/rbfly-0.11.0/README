RbFly is a library for RabbitMQ Streams using Python asyncio

- https://www.rabbitmq.com/streams.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html

The library is designed and implemented with the following qualities in
mind

1. Simple, flexible, and asynchronous Pythonic API with type annotations.
2. Use of AMQP 1.0 message format to enable interoperability between
   RabbitMQ Streams clients.
3. Performance by implementing critical sections of code using Cython,
   avoiding copying of data, and testing.
4. Auto reconnection to RabbitMQ broker with lazily created connection
   objects.

RbFly supports many RabbitMQ Streams broker features

1. Publishing single messages, or in batches, with confirmation.
2. Subscribing to a stream at a specific point in time, from a specific
   offset, or using offset reference.
3. Stream message filtering.
4. Writing stream offset reference.
5. Message deduplication.
6. Integration with AMQP 1.0 ecosystem at message format level.
7. TLS and authentication with X.509 certificates.
