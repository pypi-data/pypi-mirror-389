## 0.6.0

- Added option counting:
  - Given an option named `verbose` with `count=True` with a `v` alias, passing `-vvv` results in `3`
- Added combining short options:
  - Given an option named `verbose` with `count=True` with a `v` alias and an option named `debug` with a `d` alias that is a boolean, passing `-vvd` would result in `verbose` being `2` and `debug` being `True`
- Added `on_invalid_option_value` hook which is called when a counted option is directly given a non-integer value
