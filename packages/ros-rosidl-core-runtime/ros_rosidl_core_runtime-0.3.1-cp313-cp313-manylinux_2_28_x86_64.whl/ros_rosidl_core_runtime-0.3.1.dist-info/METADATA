# rosidl_core_runtime

Provides CMake functionality for finding and adding runtime dependencies for packages providing ROS message definitions.

## Features

The *features* of this package consist entirely of serving as a gathering place for all runtime related dependencies of ROS interface packages.
These dependencies can be found in the [package.xml](package.xml).
This helps reduce the boilerplate needed when developers create their own ROS interface packages.

## Quality Declaration

This package claims to be in the **Quality Level 1** category, see the [Quality Declaration](QUALITY_DECLARATION.md) for more details.
