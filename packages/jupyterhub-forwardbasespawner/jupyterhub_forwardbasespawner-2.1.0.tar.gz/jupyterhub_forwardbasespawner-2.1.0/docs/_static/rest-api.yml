        This endpoint has to be called with a token, that has the
        `access:servers` scope, e.g. the `JUPYTERHUB_API_TOKEN` of the server.
        
        This endpoint can be used to send progress events to the JupyterHub
        directly from the start process itself. This may be useful, if your
        SpawnerClass will not have all information of the start process, but
        the start process will have to check it by themself.

        It can also be used to cancel a pending spawn process with setting
        `failed`: `true`.

        If `html_message` is used, the current timestamp (format
        "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f") will be used as prefix. When the `html_message`
        starts with `<details><summary>` the timestamp will be placed like this:
        `<details><summary>{now}: `

        was restarted.
