**Flaskteroids** (or Flask on Steroids) is a lightweight yet powerful
Python MVC framework that supercharges **Flask** with a clean, elegant structure.
Inspired by the best of **Ruby on Rails**, it brings clarity and productivity
to your web development workflow.

Built on the philosophy of **convention over configuration**, Flaskteroids helps
you move fast, write less code, and stay focused on what matters: building
scalable, maintainable applications with confidence.

With a **batteries-included** approach and carefully chosen core dependencies,
Flaskteroids stays lean, fast, and secure — giving you everything you need,
and nothing you don’t.

## Features

- **Full MVC Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with Models, Views,
  and Controllers.
- **Elegant Routing**: Intuitive and resourceful routing.
- **Built-in ORM**: Seamless integration with SQLAlchemy and Alembic for database management and migrations.
- **Background Jobs**: Integrated with Celery for easy background job processing.
- **RESTful by Design**: Quickly build API routes with JSON responses.
- **Powerful CLI**: A rich set of commands for generating models, controllers, mailers, scaffolds, and more.
- **Flask Compatibility**: Retains the full power of Flask and its rich ecosystem.

## Installation

To get started, install the Flaskteroids package using `pip`:

```sh
pip install flaskteroids
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Creating a New App

Create a new Flaskteroids application using the `flaskteroids new` command:

```sh
flaskteroids new my_app
cd my_app
```

This creates a new directory called `my_app` with a standard application structure.

### 2. Running the Server

To start the development server, run:

```sh
flask run
```

Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
You should see the Flaskteroids welcome page!

## Your First Feature: A Blog

Let's create a simple blog to see the power of scaffolding.
Inside your `my_app` follow the next steps:

1. **Generate a Post scaffold:**
   This command will create the model, controller, views, and database
   migration for a `Post` resource with `title` and `content` fields.

   ```sh
   flask generate scaffold Post title:string content:text
   ```

2. **Run the database migration:**
   Apply the changes to your database schema.

   ```sh
   flask db:migrate
   ```

3. **Start the server:**

   ```sh
   flask run
   ```

Now, visit `http://1227.0.0.1:5000/posts` in your browser.
You have a complete set of pages to create, view, update, and delete posts.
