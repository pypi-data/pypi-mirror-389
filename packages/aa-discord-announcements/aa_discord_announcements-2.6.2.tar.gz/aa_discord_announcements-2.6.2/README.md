## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

This app is a plugin for Alliance Auth. If you don't have Alliance Auth running already,
please install it first before proceeding.
(See the official [AA installation guide](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/allianceauth.html) for details)

> [!NOTE]
>
> You also want to make sure that you have the
> [Discord service](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/services/discord.html)
> installed, configured and activated before installing this app.

### Bare Metal Installation<a name="bare-metal-installation"></a>

#### Step 1: Install the App<a name="step-1-install-the-app"></a>

Then install the latest version:

```shell
pip install aa-discord-announcements
```

#### Step 2: Update Your AA Settings<a name="step-2-update-your-aa-settings"></a>

Configure your AA settings (`local.py`) as follows:

- Add `"aa_discord_announcements",` to `INSTALLED_APPS`

#### Step 3: Finalizing the Installation<a name="step-3-finalizing-the-installation"></a>

Copy static files and run migrations

```shell
python manage.py collectstatic
python manage.py migrate
```

Restart your supervisor services for AA

### Docker Installation<a name="docker-installation"></a>

#### Step 1: Add the App<a name="step-1-add-the-app"></a>

Add the app to your `conf/requirements.txt`

```text
aa-discord-announcements==2.6.2
```

#### Step 2: Update Your AA Settings<a name="step-2-update-your-aa-settings-1"></a>

Configure your AA settings (`conf/local.py`) as follows:

#### Step 3: Build Auth and Restart Your Containers<a name="step-3-build-auth-and-restart-your-containers"></a>

Now you can set up permissions in Alliance Auth for your users.
Add `aa_discord_announcements | general | Can access this app` to the states and/or
groups you would like to have access.

#### Setting up the App<a name="setting-up-the-app"></a>

In your admin backend you'll find a new section called `Discord Announcements`.
This is where you set all your stuff up, like the webhooks you want to ping and who
can ping them. It's pretty straight forward, so you shouldn't have any issues. Go nuts!
