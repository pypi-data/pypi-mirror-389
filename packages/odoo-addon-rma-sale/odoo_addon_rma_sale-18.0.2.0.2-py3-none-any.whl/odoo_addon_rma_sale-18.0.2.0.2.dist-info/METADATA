This module allows you to link a sales order to an RMA. This can be done
by creating an RMA from scratch and selecting the sales order, creating
one or more RMAs from a sales order form view or from a sales order web
portal page.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to *RMA > Orders* and create a new RMA.
2. Select a sales order to be linked to the RMA if you want.
3. Now you can do the rest of the instructions described in the *readme*
   of the rma module.

If you want to create one or more RMAs from a sale order:

1. Go to *Sales > Orders > Orders*.
2. Create a new sales order or select an existing one.
3. If the sales order is in 'Sales Order' state you can see in the
   status bar a button labeled 'Create RMA', click it and a wizard will
   appear.
4. Modify the data at your convenience and click on 'Accept' button.
5. As many RMAs as lines with quantity greater than zero will be
   created. Those RMAs will be linked to the sales order.

The customer can also create RMAs from a sales order portal page:

1. Go to a confirmed sales order portal page.
2. In the left sidebar you can see a button named 'Request RMAs'.
3. By clicking on this button a popup will appear to allow you to define
   the quantity per product and delivery order line.
4. Click on the 'Request RMAs' button and RMAs will be created linked to
   the sales order.

Single page RMA request:

1. Go to Sales > Configuration > Settings
2. Check the 'Single page RMA request' box.
3. On a sales order in the portal, clicking on 'Request RMAs' button
   will open a new page (not a popup).

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- When you try to request an RMA from a Sales Order in the portal, a
  popup appears and the inputs for the quantity doesn't allow decimal
  numbers. It would be good to have a component that allows that and at
  the same time keeps the constraint of not allowing a number greater
  than the order line product quantity.
