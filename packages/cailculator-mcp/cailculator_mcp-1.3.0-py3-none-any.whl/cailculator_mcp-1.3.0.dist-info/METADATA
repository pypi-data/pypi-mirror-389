# CAILculator MCP Server

High-dimensional data analysis via Model Context Protocol.

Powered by proprietary Chavez Transform technology with proven mathematical foundations.

## Features

- **Advanced Pattern Detection**: Find hidden structures in high-dimensional data
- **Framework-Independent Analysis**: Works across different mathematical representations
- **Proven Reliability**: Built on verified mathematical theorems
- **Scales from 16D to 256D**: Handles complexity traditional methods can't

## 🔬 Quant Trader Tier - BETA

**For serious quantitative analysts who work with large datasets**

### Optimized for Gemini CLI (recommended)
- **Large context window** for GB-scale analysis
- Command-line workflow for automated strategies
- Seamless integration with your existing data pipelines

**Also supports:** Claude Desktop, Claude Code (datasets <100MB recommended)

---

### 📊 Large Dataset Processing
- Handle **GB-scale** files with smart sampling strategy
- Batch processing for years of historical data
- Memory-efficient chunked reading for massive datasets

### 📈 Technical Indicators (10 Professional Indicators)
- **Momentum**: RSI, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator
- **Trend**: SMA/EMA, ADX, Ichimoku Cloud
- **Volatility**: Bollinger Bands, ATR
- **Volume**: OBV, VWAP
- Signal interpretation and trading recommendations included

### 🗣️ Financial Terminology Translation
Three output levels to match your expertise:
- **Technical**: Full mathematical notation (for quants/researchers)
- **Standard**: Industry terminology (for traders/analysts)
- **Simple**: Plain English (for beginners/executives)

Example: "Conjugation symmetry" → "Mean reversion strength" → "How strongly price returns to average"

### 🎯 Smart Analysis
- Regime detection (bull/bear/sideways market classification)
- Pattern discovery with confidence scoring
- Anomaly detection for unusual market events

## 🏆 PREMIUM: Dual-Method Regime Detection

**This is what separates CAILculator from Bloomberg.**

Everyone has Hidden Markov Models. Nobody has mathematical structure analysis.

### The Unique Advantage

**Statistical Method (what everyone has):**
- Hidden Markov Models analyze price momentum
- Standard quant finance approach
- Classifies regimes as bull/bear/sideways

**Mathematical Structure (UNIQUE to CAILculator):**
- Chavez Transform in 32D sedenion space
- Conjugation symmetry analysis
- Zero divisor pattern detection
- Structural stability assessment

### When Both Methods Agree → High Confidence
When statistical momentum AND mathematical structure point the same direction, trade with confidence.

### When They Disagree → WARNING
Disagreement often precedes regime changes. Like getting conflicting opinions from two specialists - time to investigate further.

### Three Explanation Levels

**Simple**: "Your data looks wobbly - like a seesaw getting unbalanced. When we see this, things might change soon."

**Standard**: "Price action suggests bullish continuation, but mathematical structure shows instability (symmetry: 0.34). Methods disagree - caution advised."

**Technical**: "HMM classification: bull (p=0.82). Conjugation symmetry: 0.34 (structural breakdown). Zero divisor count: 7 (bifurcation risk: HIGH). Agreement: 0.32 → INVESTIGATE FURTHER."

## Installation

```bash
pip install cailculator-mcp
```

For HTTP transport (Gemini CLI support):
```bash
pip install cailculator-mcp[http]
```

## Setup

CAILculator MCP Server supports **two transport modes**:
- **stdio** (default): For Claude Desktop
- **http**: For Gemini CLI and other HTTP-based MCP clients

### Setup for Claude Desktop (stdio mode)

Add to your MCP client configuration:

**Mac/Linux:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cailculator": {
      "command": "cailculator-mcp",
      "env": {
        "CAILCULATOR_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Setup for Gemini CLI (HTTP mode)

#### 1. Start the HTTP server:

```bash
cailculator-mcp --transport http --port 8080
```

Or with custom host/port:
```bash
cailculator-mcp --transport http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Set your API key via environment variable:
```bash
export CAILCULATOR_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
# Windows: set CAILCULATOR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Important:** The server will not start without a valid API key. Contact paul@chavezailabs.com for API access.

#### 2. Configure Gemini CLI:

Add to `~/.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cailculator": {
      "manifestUrl": "http://localhost:8080/mcp/manifest"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Available endpoints:

- **GET /mcp/manifest** - Tool definitions (required by Gemini CLI)
- **POST /message** - MCP JSON-RPC messages
- **GET /health** - Health check endpoint

The HTTP server provides the same tools as stdio mode but with Gemini's 2M token context window, ideal for large regime detection responses.
