# lks-idprovider-fastapi

Provider-agnostic FastAPI integration for lks-idprovider API protocols.

This package provides reusable FastAPI dependencies, decorators, and middleware for REST API security, based on the lks-idprovider API protocols. It is not tied to any specific provider implementation (e.g., Keycloak) and can be used with any compatible backend.

## Features
- Bearer token security scheme for OpenAPI
- AuthContext dependency for user/client authentication
- Role-based and route protection dependencies
- Easy integration with any provider implementing the API protocols

## Usage
1. Install this package and your chosen provider implementation.
2. Configure your provider (e.g., Keycloak) in your FastAPI app.
3. Inject the provider into the dependencies from this package.
