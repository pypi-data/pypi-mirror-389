### Fixed

#### Critical Security Vulnerabilities

1. **Command Injection (CVSS 9.8)**
   - **Location**: `src/lionagi_qe/agents/test_executor.py:156`
   - **Issue**: `shell=True` in subprocess.run() allowed arbitrary command execution
   - **Fix**: Switched to list-based arguments with `shell=False`
   - **Impact**: Prevents attackers from injecting malicious commands via test file paths

2. **Arbitrary Code Execution (CVSS 9.1)**
   - **Location**: `src/lionagi_qe/agents/test_executor.py:203`
   - **Issue**: Unrestricted function access via `globals()[func_name]`
   - **Fix**: Implemented function whitelist with allowed operations only
   - **Impact**: Prevents execution of arbitrary Python functions

3. **Insecure Deserialization (CVSS 8.8)**
   - **Location**: `src/lionagi_qe/core/hooks.py:287`
   - **Issue**: `pickle.loads()` on untrusted data could execute arbitrary code
   - **Fix**: Replaced pickle with JSON for safe deserialization
   - **Impact**: Eliminates code execution risk from malicious payloads

#### High Priority Security Issues

4. **Path Traversal (CVSS 7.5)**
   - **Location**: `src/lionagi_qe/tools/code_analyzer.py:94`
   - **Issue**: Missing path validation allowed reading arbitrary files
   - **Fix**: Added path validation and sandboxing to project directory
   - **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized file access outside project scope

5. **Unvalidated Input (CVSS 7.2)**
   - **Location**: `src/lionagi_qe/core/base_agent.py:412`
   - **Issue**: No schema validation on fuzzy parsing input
   - **Fix**: Added JSON schema validation with size limits
   - **Impact**: Prevents DoS attacks from malformed JSON

6. **Missing Rate Limiting (CVSS 6.8)**
   - **Location**: `src/lionagi_qe/core/hooks.py:156`
   - **Issue**: No throttling on AI API calls
   - **Fix**: Implemented configurable rate limiting
   - **Impact**: Prevents cost explosion from runaway API calls

#### Regression Issues

7. **Duplicate Method Definition**
   - **Issue**: `execute_fan_out_fan_in()` defined twice in QEOrchestrator (lines 225 and 436)
   - **Fix**: Renamed new method to `execute_parallel_fan_out_fan_in()` to maintain backward compatibility
   - **Impact**: 100% backward compatibility maintained, no breaking changes

### Changed
