``unimpeded`` 

It can be viewed as an extension to the Planck legacy archive across models and datasets

It provides mcmc and nested sampling chains, allowing parameter estimation, model comparison and tension quantification.

Current functionality includes:

Features
--------

Installation
------------

``unimpeded`` can be installed via pip

.. code:: bash

    pip install unimpeded

or via the setup.py

.. code:: bash

    cd unimpeded
    python -m pip install .

You can check that things are working by running the test suite:

.. code:: bash

    export MPLBACKEND=Agg     # only necessary for OSX users
    python -m pytest
    flake8 unimpeded tests
    pydocstyle --convention=numpy unimpeded


Dependencies

    make html

and view the documentation by opening ``docs/build/html/index.html`` in a browser. To regenerate the automatic RST files run:

.. code:: bash

    sphinx-apidoc -fM -t docs/templates/ -o docs/source/ unimpeded/

Citation
--------

If you use ``unimpeded`` to generate plots for a publication, please cite
as: ::

   Handley, (2023) unimpeded: cosmological inference across models and datasets. 

or using the BibTeX:

.. code:: bibtex

   @article{unimpeded,
       year  = {2023},
       author = {Will Handley},
       title = {unimpeded: cosmological inference across models and datasets},
       journal = {In preparation}
