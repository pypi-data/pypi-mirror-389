HSI Preprocessing Toolkit (HPT, formerly HDR2MAT) is a hyperspectral image preprocessing toolset that:
1. Read the raw data from the HSI camera, and convert it into `.mat` file
2. Read the `.mat` file
3. Preview HSI, and convert it to RGB `.png` file
4. Crop and rotate the HSI and preview in realtime
5. Select spectrals of interest visually and save them into a `.mat` file
6. Mix multiple HSI images with layers. (coming in v2.0.0)
7. Some other utils


## Usage
### Manual
1. Download from GitHub release
2. Double click the `start.cmd` file. Make sure you have internet access during the first start.

### Install with pip
```sh
pip install hsi-preprocessing-toolkit
hsi_preprocessing_toolkit
```

### Install with uv
```sh
uvx hsi_preprocessing_toolkit
```
or install as a tool
```sh
uv tool install hsi-preprocessing-toolkit
hsi_preprocessing_toolkit
```
