## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-03

### Added
- **CompositeEnvironment API parity**: Added `bins_in_region()`, `mask_for_region()`, `shortest_path()`, `info()`, `save()`, and `load()` methods to CompositeEnvironment for full API compatibility with Environment class
- **KDTree-optimized spatial queries**: CompositeEnvironment.bin_at() now uses KDTree for O(M log N) performance instead of O(N×M) sequential queries (enabled by default via `use_kdtree_query=True`)
- **Structured logging infrastructure**: New `_logging.py` module with NullHandler by default, enabling optional logging for debugging and workflow tracing
- **Centralized numerical constants**: New `_constants.py` module consolidating all magic numbers (tolerances, KDTree parameters, epsilon values) for consistent behavior
- **Comprehensive type validation**: CompositeEnvironment constructor now validates input types with actionable error messages
- **Graph metadata validation**: Added `validate_connectivity_graph()` to enforce required node/edge attributes from layout engines
- **Dimensionality support documentation**: New `docs/dimensionality_support.md` clarifying 1D/2D/3D feature support with compatibility matrix

### Changed
- **Updated alignment module**: Now uses centralized constants (`IDW_MIN_DISTANCE`, `KDTREE_LEAF_SIZE`)
- **Updated regions module**: Uses `POINT_TOLERANCE` constant for consistent geometric comparisons
- **Enhanced error messages**: CompositeEnvironment now provides detailed diagnostics for dimension mismatches and type errors
- **Clarified 2D-only transforms**: Updated `transforms.py` docstring to explicitly state 2D-only status and suggest scipy for 3D

### Fixed
- Removed unused `type: ignore` comment in `regular_grid.py`
- Fixed potential `KeyError` in logging by renaming `name` parameter to `env_name` (avoids conflict with LogRecord reserved field)

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive dimensionality support guide (1D/2D/3D feature matrix)
- Updated CLAUDE.md with latest patterns and requirements
- Added 18 new tests for CompositeEnvironment type validation
- Added 23 new tests for Environment error path coverage
- Added 28 new tests for graph validation

### Internal
- Consolidated duplicate dimension inference code (already done in earlier commits, verified)
- All 614 tests passing
- Ruff and mypy checks passing
- Test coverage: 78%
