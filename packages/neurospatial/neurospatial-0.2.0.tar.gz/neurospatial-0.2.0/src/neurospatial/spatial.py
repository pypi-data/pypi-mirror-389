"""spatial.py - Spatial query utilities for neurospatial
========================================================

This module provides high-performance spatial query utilities including:
- Batch mapping of points to bins with KD-tree caching
- Deterministic tie-breaking on bin boundaries
- Distance calculations

These are core primitives used throughout neurospatial and by downstream packages.

    """Map points to bin indices with deterministic tie-breaking.

    This function provides fast, batch mapping of continuous coordinates to
    discrete bin indices using KD-tree queries. It handles edge cases like
    boundary points consistently through configurable tie-breaking rules.

    Internally caches a KD-tree on first call for O(log N) lookups.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : NDArray[np.float64], shape (n_points, n_dims)
        Continuous coordinates to map to bins.
    env : Environment
        Environment containing the bin discretization.
    tie_break : {"lowest_index", "closest_center"}, default="lowest_index"
        Strategy for resolving ties when a point is equidistant from multiple
        bin centers:

        - "lowest_index": Choose the bin with smallest index (deterministic)
        - "closest_center": Return the actual closest (may be non-deterministic
          for exact ties, but faster)

    return_dist : bool, default=False
        If True, also return the distance from each point to its assigned bin center.
    max_distance : float, optional
        Absolute distance threshold in physical units. Points farther than this
        from the nearest bin center are marked as outside (-1). Cannot be used
        with max_distance_factor.
    max_distance_factor : float, optional
        Relative distance threshold as a multiple of typical bin spacing. Points
        farther than (max_distance_factor × typical_bin_spacing) from the nearest
        bin center are marked as outside (-1). Cannot be used with max_distance.

    Returns
    -------
    bin_indices : NDArray[np.int_], shape (n_points,)
        Bin index for each point. Value of -1 indicates point is outside all bins.
    distances : NDArray[np.float64], shape (n_points,), optional
        Distance from each point to its assigned bin center.
        Only returned if `return_dist=True`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If both max_distance and max_distance_factor are specified, or if either
        is negative, or if invalid tie_break mode.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from neurospatial import Environment
    >>> from neurospatial.spatial import map_points_to_bins
    >>> data = np.random.randn(1000, 2) * 10
    >>> env = Environment.from_samples(data, bin_size=2.0)
    >>> points = np.array([[0.0, 0.0], [10.0, 10.0], [50.0, 50.0]])
    >>> bins = map_points_to_bins(points, env)
    >>> bins
    array([ 42,  89,  -1])

    >>> # Get distances too
    >>> bins, dists = map_points_to_bins(points, env, return_dist=True)
    >>> dists
    array([0.23, 0.45, inf])

    >>> # Filter outliers with absolute threshold
    >>> bins = map_points_to_bins(points, env, max_distance=15.0)

    >>> # Filter outliers with relative threshold (adapts to bin size)
    >>> bins = map_points_to_bins(points, env, max_distance_factor=1.5)

    Notes
    -----
    This function builds and caches a KD-tree on the environment's bin_centers
    on first call. Subsequent calls reuse the cached tree for O(log N) performance.

    The cache is stored as a private attribute on the Environment object.

    **IMPORTANT**: Environment objects are designed to be immutable after creation.
    Modifying bin_centers or other spatial attributes after creation will cause
    the cache to become stale and produce incorrect results. If you need a modified
    environment, create a new Environment instance instead.

    The typical bin spacing is estimated using deterministic quantile-based
    sampling for reproducibility.
