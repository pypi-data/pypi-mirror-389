# cppark

cppark is a unified toolchain orchestrator for C++ development.
It brings together formatting, linting, testing, dependency management and profiling into a single lightweight interface — allowing you to develop with clarity and rhythm, instead of wrestling with scattered scripts and command-line incantations.
