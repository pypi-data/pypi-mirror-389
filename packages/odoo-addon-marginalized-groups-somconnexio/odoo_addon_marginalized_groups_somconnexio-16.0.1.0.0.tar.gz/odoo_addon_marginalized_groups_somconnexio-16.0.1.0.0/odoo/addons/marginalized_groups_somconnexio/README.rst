This module supports the marginalized groups project at SomConnexio,
aiming to help people in economically vulnerable situations by lowering
their billing prices. It adds partner categories with
marginalized_group_categ as the parent, representing different
sub-programs of the marginalized group program. If a partner is tagged
with these categories, they will be marked as is_in_CM_program. Also,
marginalized_group_agent_id is the entity that accredits their
marginalized group status. A PDF attachment is sent to them with the
specific conditions of each sub-program once their partner's leads
petitions are created (see reports from this module).

 Usage
*******

Tag a partner with one of the sub-programs of the marginalized group
program to mark them as is_in_CM_program. The partner will receive a PDF
attachment with the specific conditions of the sub-program once their
partner's leads petitions are created.

This module does not directly affect the billing process, which is not
yet implemented.
