			       MASTO-MAILO-INATOR
			       ==================

1. WTF?

Masto-mailo-inator is a short program which fetches toots and stores them as
emails (Maildir format). They can they be read from the comfort of your email
client

2. How

For now the project is not distributed via pip, so you need to clone it 
manually and run with uv or sth. Two commands are supported:

- setup (configures the program)
- get (fetches and stores new toots)

Refer to the official website for more info, including plans.
