			       MASTO-MAILO-INATOR
			       ==================

1. WTF?

Masto-mailo-inator is a short program which fetches toots and stores them as
emails (Maildir format). They can they be read from the comfort of your email
client

Official website: https://michal.sapka.pl/projects/masto-mailo-inator

2. How

For now the project is not distributed via pip, so you need to clone it 
manually and run with uv or sth. Two commands are supported:

- setup (configures the program)
- get (fetches and stores new toots)

Refer to the official website for more info, including plans.
