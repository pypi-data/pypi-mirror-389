SSAW is a Python library to access the [Survey Solutions API](<https://mysurvey.solutions>). This library enables you to manage resources such as creating assignments, users, maps; as well as perform workflow actions, like approving interviews, reassigning workspaces etc in your Python applications.


```python
import ssaw

# First, initialize connection with the server
client = ssaw.Client('https://demo.mysurvey.solutions', 'api_user', 'api_password')

# Get list of questionnaires
for q in ssaw.QuestionnairesApi(client).get_list():
    print(q.title)

# Download the latest exported data in SPSS format
filename = ssaw.ExportApi(client).get(export_type="SPSS",        
    questionnaire_identity="64136490cbc24a71a1df10f4b7115599$1")
```
