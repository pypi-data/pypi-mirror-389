DeTrusty is a federated query engine.
At this stage, only SPARQL endpoints are supported.
DeTrusty differs from other query engines through its focus on the explainability and trustworthiness of the query result.

> [!NOTE]
> DeTrusty is under **active development!**
> The current version is a federated query engine following the SPARQL 1.1 protocol, i.e., you can use the SERVICE clause to specify the endpoints manually.
> However, some features of SPARQL 1.1 and the parts about the explainability and trustworthiness have not been implemented yet.

Currently, DeTrusty only supports ``SELECT`` queries.
The following SPARQL 1.1 operations are not supported (yet).
This list might not be exhaustive. Please, let us know if we missed something.
- Conditional functions, e.g., `IF`, `BOUND`, `COALESCE`
- Built-in functions, e.g., `isIRI`, `STRLEN`, `abs`, `floor`, `now`, `month`, `MD5`
- Specifying RDF datasets using `FROM`, `FROM NAMED`, or `GRAPH`

If you want to know more, check out the [documentation](https://sdm-tib.github.io/DeTrusty/).

## Running DeTrusty
You can use DeTrusty as a Python3 library or a Web-based service using Docker.
The documentation includes detailed examples and explanations for both scenarios.
