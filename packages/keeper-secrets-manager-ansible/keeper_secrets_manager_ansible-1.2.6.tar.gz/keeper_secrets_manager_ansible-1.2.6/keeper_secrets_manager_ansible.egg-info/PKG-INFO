* `keeper_get_record` - Retrieve records as a dictionary.
* `keeper_set` - Update an existing record from Ansible information.
* `keeper_init` - Initialize a KSM configuration from a one-time access token.
* `keeper_cleanup` - Remove the cache file, if being used.
* `keeper_lookup` - Retrieve secrets from a record using Ansible's lookup.
* `keeper_redact` - Stdout Callback plugin to redact secrets from logs.
* `keeper_password` - Generate a random password.
* `keeper_info` - Display information about plugin, record and field types.
