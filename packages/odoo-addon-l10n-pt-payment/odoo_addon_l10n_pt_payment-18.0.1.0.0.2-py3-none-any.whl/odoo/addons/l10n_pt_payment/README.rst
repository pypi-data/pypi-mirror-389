This module declares Portugal-specific payment methods that are widely
used in the Portuguese market:

- **Multibanco** (code: ``mb``) - Portugal's most popular payment method
  for ATM and online banking payments
- **MB Way** (code: ``mbway``) - Mobile payment solution widely used in
  Portugal

These payment methods can be used by payment providers that support
Portuguese payment systems.

Usage
=====

After installing this module, the Multibanco and MB WAY payment methods
will be available in the system.

Payment providers that support these methods (such as EasyPay, Eupago,
or IfthenPay) can reference these payment methods using their codes:

- Multibanco: ``mb``
- MB WAY: ``mbway``

The payment method icons will be displayed automatically in the payment
forms when these methods are enabled on a payment provider.
