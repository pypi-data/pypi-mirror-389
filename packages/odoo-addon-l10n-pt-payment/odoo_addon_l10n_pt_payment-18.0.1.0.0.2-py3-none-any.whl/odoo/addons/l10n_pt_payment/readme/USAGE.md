After installing this module, the Multibanco and MB WAY payment methods
will be available in the system.

Payment providers that support these methods (such as EasyPay, Eupago,
or IfthenPay) can reference these payment methods using their codes:

- Multibanco: `mb`
- MB WAY: `mbway`

The payment method icons will be displayed automatically in the payment
forms when these methods are enabled on a payment provider.
