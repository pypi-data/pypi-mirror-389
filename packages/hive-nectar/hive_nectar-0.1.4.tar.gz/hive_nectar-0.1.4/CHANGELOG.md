# Changelog

## 0.1.4b - 2025-10-12

- **Refactor**: Refactored **Account**’s vote‑pct calculation to correctly convert the desired token value to an `Amount`, introduce a safe ratio clamp (‑10 to 10) to avoid extreme values, and return 0 for zero‑vote scenarios; updated all discussion query fallbacks to use the *condenser* API and handle dict‑style responses, and tweaked tests to instantiate `Account` directly.

## 0.1.4b - 2025-09-19

- **Feature**: Added payout-based vote helpers on `Comment` :
  - `Comment.to_zero(account, partial=100.0, broadcast=False)` computes the UI downvote percent to reduce a post's pending payout to approximately zero (uses reward fund + median price + effective vesting shares; scales by the account's downvoting power). Returns negative UI percent, can broadcast when requested.
  - `Comment.to_token_value(account, hbd, partial=100.0, broadcast=False)` computes the UI upvote percent to contribute approximately the given HBD value. Returns positive UI percent, can broadcast when requested.
- **Fix**: Corrected vote value math to align with the beem reference formula:
  - Restored `get_hbd_per_rshares()` to derive HBD/share as `(reward_balance / recent_claims) * median_price(HBD/HIVE)` .
  - Applied the missing `/ 100` scale factor from the sample when converting rshares to HBD-equivalent in payout-based helpers.
  - `ActiveVotes.get_downvote_pct_to_zero()` updated to use effective vesting shares and the account's downvoting power; analytic path improved and payout-based path added via `Comment.to_zero()` .
  - `vests_to_rshares()` reverted to chain-accurate power computation via `_calc_resulting_vote` and dust-threshold handling.
  - `rshares_to_vote_pct()` updated to invert the chain power model consistently (taking max_vote_denom into account).
- **Docs/Examples**: Added `examples/get_vote_pct_script.py` showing how to compute both the downvote-to-zero percent and the upvote percent to reach a target HBD.

## 0.1.3 - 2025-09-18

- **Test**: Working on getting 100% test coverage
- **Feature**: Added some HAF features for things like reputation.

## 0.1.2 - 2025-09-17

- **Fix**: Replaced missing `**kwargs` in `Blocks` constructor.

## 0.1.1 - 2025-09-17

- **Fix**: Added support for `only_ops` and `only_virtual_ops` parameters in `Blocks` constructor.

## 0.1.0b - 2025-09-17

- **Breaking Change**: Killed everything that was not specifcally HIVE related. If you used this for STEEM and / or Blurt, they are no longer supported.
- **Fix**: Corrected inverted fallback logic in chain detection to prefer HIVE over STEEM when `blockchain_name` is None.
- **Fix**: Restored backward compatibility for constructor parameters:
  - `Vote.__init__`: Added support for deprecated `steem_instance` and `hive_instance` kwargs with deprecation warnings.
  - `ActiveVotes.__init__`: Added support for deprecated `steem_instance` and `hive_instance` kwargs with deprecation warnings.
  - `Witness.__init__`: Added `**kwargs` with warnings for unexpected parameters.
  - `Comment_options.__init__`: Added fallback support for deprecated `percent_steem_dollars` parameter.
- **Improvement**: Removed deprecated websocket support from GrapheneRPC, now only supports HTTP/requests for better reliability and maintainability.
- **Improvement**: Simplified ecdsasig.py to use only cryptography library, removing complex conditional logic for different secp256k1 implementations. The `tweak_add` operation now raises NotImplementedError when called.
- **Major Feature**: Implemented pure Python secp256k1 elliptic curve operations for PublicKey.add() method, restoring compatibility with existing code that relies on key derivation. The implementation includes proper validation, error handling, and maintains the same API as before. All unit tests pass successfully.
- **Fix**: Fixed HiveSigner integration in TransactionBuilder:
  - Updated appendSigner() to restrict permissions to 'posting' when using HiveSigner
  - Fixed sign() method to properly call hivesigner.sign() and attach signatures instead of returning early
  - Fixed broadcast() method to use hivesigner.broadcast() when use_hs is True
  - Added proper error handling and fallbacks for non-HiveSigner flows
  - **Fix**: Fixed HiveSigner.broadcast() call in TransactionBuilder to pass operations list instead of full transaction JSON, and include username when available
- **Fix**: Fixed Claim_reward_balance operation serialization in nectarbase/operations.py:
  - Removed incorrect mutually-exclusive logic between reward_hive and reward_hbd
  - Updated to always serialize all four fields in canonical order: account, reward_hive, reward_hbd, reward_vests
  - Added proper zero-amount defaults ("0.000 HIVE"/"0.000 HBD") for missing reward fields
  - Updated docstring to reflect correct behavior and field requirements
- **Fix**: Convert beneficiary weights from `HIVE_100_PERCENT` units (10000) to percentages in `Comment.get_beneficiaries_pct()` to ensure accurate outputs.
- **Fix**: Improve ECDSA signing to correctly handle prehashed messages and tighten signature canonicalization checks for better interoperability.
- **Refactor**: Reorder wallet lock verification to run after HiveSigner validation in `TransactionBuilder`, preventing premature lock errors for HiveSigner flows.
- **Refactor**: Replace implicit stdin default with an explicit blockchain selection in the CLI argument parser to avoid ambiguous behavior.
- **Refactor**: Update default Hive node configuration to use HTTPS endpoints instead of WSS.
- **Feature**: Add a pure-Python fallback for public key derivation when the `ecdsa` library is unavailable, improving portability.

## 0.0.11 - 2025-07-25

- Fixed handling of missing `community` field in comments (`Comment`) and improved `weighted_score` type check in node list ranking (`NodeList`).

## 0.0.10 - 2025-07-12

- Emergency hotfix: lower-case the UTC timestamp suffix during permlink generation (in `derive_permlink`) to resolve validation errors caused by the uppercase `U`.

## 0.0.9 - 2025-07-12

- Refactored `nodelist` logic:
  - `update_nodes` now reads authoritative node metadata from `nectarflower` account `json_metadata` only.
  - Uses `weighted_score` directly for ranking and zeroes scores for nodes missing from the report.
  - Dynamically adds new nodes from the report and failing list, ensuring completeness.
  - Removed unused fall-back paths and cleaned up internal code.
