# Super Secref Finder

**Super Secref Finder** is an advanced regex-based security scanner designed to discover sensitive information like API keys, passwords, tokens, and other secrets exposed within web applications and their associated JavaScript files. It leverages a comprehensive collection of regular expressions and employs multi-threading for efficient scanning of large websites.

It can scan a target URL to find and analyze its linked JavaScript files, or scan a specific JavaScript file directly.

## Features

- **Advanced Regex Engine:** Utilizes a powerful regex engine with customizable patterns for precise secret detection. Includes a curated list of common sensitive patterns (e.g., AWS keys, JWT tokens, various API keys).
- **Multi-threaded Scanning:** Employs multi-threading to significantly speed up the scanning process, allowing for efficient analysis of large websites and numerous JavaScript files.
- **JavaScript File Analysis:** Can be pointed directly at a `.js` file URL for scanning. When scanning a main URL, it automatically extracts and analyzes linked JavaScript files for exposed secrets.
- **Interactive Menu:** Provides a user-friendly interactive menu for easy configuration of target URL, thread count, request delay, and verbose output options.
- **Contextualized Findings:** Presents findings with surrounding context to aid in quick verification and analysis of potential vulnerabilities.
- **False Positive Filtering:** Includes a mechanism to log and filter potential false positives, improving the accuracy of the results.
- **JSON Output:** Saves scan results in a structured JSON format for easy integration with other security tools and workflows.
- **Summary Reporting:** Generates a summary of findings categorized by secret type for a quick overview of discovered vulnerabilities.
- **Customizable Confidence Threshold:** Allows adjusting the confidence threshold for reported findings, balancing sensitivity and precision.
- **Rate Limit Handling:** Implements dynamic delay adjustments to handle rate limiting imposed by target servers.
- **User-Agent Spoofing:** Uses a common user agent to mimic normal browser behavior and avoid detection.
- **Error Handling and Retries:** Includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure scan completion even in the face of network issues.
- **Verbose Output:** Offers a verbose output mode for detailed information on the scanning process.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Designed to run on various operating systems.

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install super-secref-finder
```

### Option 2: Install from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LifeJiggy/Super-Secref-Finder.git
   cd Super-Secref-Finder
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment: It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate # On Linux/macOS
   .venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
   ```

## Usage

### Using the Command Line Interface

After installation, you can run the scanner from anywhere:

```bash
super-secref-finder https://example.com --threads 10 --delay 2 --verbose
```

### Using the Interactive Menu

1. Run the scanner:

   ```bash
   python Regex_patterns.py
   ```

2. Follow the interactive menu:

   - Enter the target URL (e.g., `https://example.com`) or a direct link to a JavaScript file (e.g., `https://example.com/main.js`).
   - Specify the number of threads (1-600).
   - Set the delay between requests (1-100 seconds).
   - Choose verbose output (y/n).

3. Review the results: The findings will be saved to findings.json and a summary will be displayed in the console.

## Configuration

    The sensitive_patterns.py file contains the regular expressions used for secret detection. You can customize these patterns or add new ones as needed. Ensure that the validate_pattern function in sensitive_patterns.py is updated accordingly to minimize false positives.
