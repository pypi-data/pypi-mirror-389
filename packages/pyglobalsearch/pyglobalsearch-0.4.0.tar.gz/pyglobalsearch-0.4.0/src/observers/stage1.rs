//! Stage 1 observer state tracking
//!
//! Tracks metrics during Stage 1 (reference set construction and initial scatter search).
//! Stage 1 consists of several substages that build the initial reference set used
//! in Stage 2 iterative refinement.
//!
//! ## Stage 1 Overview
//!
//! Stage 1 performs scatter search to explore the parameter space and construct
//! a diverse reference set of high-quality solutions. The process includes:
//!
//! 1. **Initialization**: Generate initial points and evaluate them
//! 2. **Diversification**: Build initial reference set through systematic sampling
//! 3. **Intensification**: Generate trial points through combination and improvement
//! 4. **Scatter Search**: Apply scatter search operators to refine the reference set
//! 5. **Local Optimization**: Apply local solvers to improve reference set quality
//!
//! ## Tracked Metrics
//!
//! - **Reference Set**: Size and quality of the solution reference set
//! - **Function Evaluations**: Total objective function calls during Stage 1
//! - **Trial Points**: Number of candidate solutions generated and tested
//! - **Substage Tracking**: Current phase of Stage 1 execution
//! - **Timing**: Duration of Stage 1 and substages (when enabled)

///
/// # Key Metrics
///
/// - **Reference Set Size**: Number of solutions in the current reference set

///
/// # Substages
///
/// Stage 1 progresses through several substages:
///
/// - `"not_started"`: Stage 1 has not begun
/// - `"scatter_search_running"`: Scatter search is initializing
/// - `"initialization_complete"`: Initial points have been evaluated
/// - `"diversification_complete"`: Initial reference set is built
/// - `"intensification_complete"`: Trial point generation is finished
/// - `"scatter_search_complete"`: Scatter search has converged

/// - `"stage1_complete"`: Stage 1 has finished (internal marker)
///
/// # Interpretation
///
/// - **Reference Set Size**: Indicates diversity and coverage of the search space
/// - **Function Evaluations**: Measures computational cost of Stage 1
/// - **Trial Points Generated**: Shows exploration intensity during intensification
/// - **Best Objective**: Tracks improvement in solution quality over time
