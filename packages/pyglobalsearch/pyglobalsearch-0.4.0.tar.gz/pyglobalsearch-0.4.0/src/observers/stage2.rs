//! Stage 2 observer state tracking
//!
//! Tracks metrics during Stage 2 (iterative improvement phase).
//! Stage 2 performs iterative refinement of the solution set through
//! merit filtering, distance-based selection, and local optimization.
//!
//! ## Stage 2 Overview
//!
//! Stage 2 iteratively improves the solution set by:
//!
//! 1. **Merit Filtering**: Select best solutions based on quality and diversity
//! 2. **Trial Point Generation**: Create new candidates from current solutions
//! 3. **Local Optimization**: Apply local solvers to improve candidate solutions
//! 4. **Solution Set Update**: Replace inferior solutions with improvements
//! 5. **Convergence Check**: Monitor for termination conditions
//!
//! ## Tracked Metrics
//!
//! - **Solution Set**: Size and quality of the maintained solution collection
//! - **Iterations**: Progress through the iterative improvement process
//! - **Local Solver Calls**: Frequency and success of local optimization
//! - **Function Evaluations**: Computational cost of Stage 2
//! - **Convergence Metrics**: Threshold values and stagnation detection
//! - **Timing**: Duration of Stage 2 execution (when enabled)
