//! # Observers Module
//!
//! The observers module provides comprehensive monitoring and tracking capabilities
//! for the OQNLP global optimization algorithm. Observers allow you to monitor the
//! algorithm's progress in real-time, collect detailed metrics about each stage of
//! the optimization process, and implement custom logging or visualization.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The OQNLP algorithm operates in two main stages:
//!
//! 1. **Stage 1 (Scatter Search)**: Explores the parameter space using scatter search
//!    metaheuristics to identify promising regions and build an initial reference set.
//! 2. **Stage 2 (Iterative Refinement)**: Performs local optimization from multiple
//!    starting points, iteratively improving the solution set through merit filtering
//!    and distance-based selection.
//!
//! Observers track key metrics for each stage, providing insights into algorithm
//! behavior, convergence patterns, and computational efficiency.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! - **Real-time Monitoring**: Track algorithm progress with customizable callbacks
//! - **Detailed Metrics**: Comprehensive statistics for both optimization stages
//! - **Flexible Configuration**: Choose which stages and metrics to monitor
//! - **Performance Tracking**: Monitor function evaluations, timing, and convergence
//! - **Custom Callbacks**: Implement custom logging, visualization, or early stopping
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The observer system consists of three main components:
//!
//! - [`Observer`]: Main coordinator that manages tracking configuration and callbacks
//! - [`Stage1State`]: Tracks metrics during scatter search and reference set construction
//! - [`Stage2State`]: Tracks metrics during iterative local refinement
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use globalsearch::observers::Observer;
//!
//! // Create an observer with tracking for both stages
//! let observer = Observer::new()
//!     .with_stage1_tracking()
//!     .with_stage2_tracking()
//!     .with_timing()
//!     .with_default_callback();
//!
//! // Use with OQNLP optimizer (see OQNLP documentation for details)
//! // let mut optimizer = OQNLP::new(problem, params).unwrap().add_observer(observer);
//! // let solutions = optimizer.run();
//!
//! // After optimization, access observer metrics
//! // if let Some(observer) = optimizer.observer() {
//! //     if let Some(stage1) = observer.stage1_final() {
//! //         println!("Stage 1 completed with {} evaluations", stage1.function_evaluations());
//! //     }
//! //     if let Some(stage2) = observer.stage2() {
//! //         println!("Stage 2 found {} solutions", stage2.solution_set_size());
//! //     }
//! // }
//! ```

///
/// The observer can be configured to track different metrics during

///
/// # Configuration Options
///
/// Observers are configured using the builder pattern:
///
/// ```rust
/// use globalsearch::observers::Observer;
///
/// // Basic observer with no tracking
/// let observer = Observer::new();
///
/// // Track both stages with default logging
/// let observer = Observer::new()
///     .with_stage1_tracking()
///     .with_stage2_tracking()
///     .with_default_callback();
///
/// // Custom configuration
/// let observer = Observer::new()
///     .with_stage1_tracking()
///     .with_timing()
///     .with_callback(|obs| {
///         // Custom callback logic
///     });
/// ```
///
/// # Configuration Options
///
/// Observers are configured using the builder pattern:
///
/// ```rust
/// use globalsearch::observers::Observer;
///
/// // Basic observer with no tracking
/// let observer = Observer::new();
///
/// // Track both stages with default logging

///         // Custom callback logic
///     });
/// ```
///
/// # Observer Modes
///
/// The observer can operate in different modes to control which stages are tracked:
///
/// - [`ObserverMode::Both`]: Track both Stage 1 and Stage 2 (default)
/// - [`ObserverMode::Stage1Only`]: Track only Stage 1 scatter search
/// - [`ObserverMode::Stage2Only`]: Track only Stage 2 local refinement
///
/// # Callback System
///
/// Callbacks allow real-time monitoring of the optimization process. They receive
/// a reference to the observer and can access all tracked metrics. Callbacks can be:
///
/// - **Default callbacks**: Pre-built logging functions for common use cases
/// - **Custom callbacks**: User-defined functions for specialized monitoring
/// - **Frequency-controlled**: Callbacks can be invoked every N iterations
///
/// # Timing Information
///
/// When timing is enabled with `with_timing()`, the observer tracks:
///
/// - Total time spent in each stage
/// - Time spent in sub-phases within Stage 1
/// - Cumulative timing information accessible via `stage1_final()` and `stage2()`
///
/// # Accessing Metrics
///
/// Metrics can be accessed in two ways:
///
/// 1. **During optimization**: Via callbacks that receive the observer reference
/// 2. **After optimization**: Via the observer stored in the OQNLP instance
///
/// ```rust
/// use globalsearch::observers::Observer;
///
/// // During optimization (in callback)
/// let observer = Observer::new()
///     .with_stage2_tracking()
///     .with_callback(|obs| {
