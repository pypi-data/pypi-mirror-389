class SVBMC:
    """
    Stacking Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (S-VBMC) is a method specifically designed to 'stack' 
    variational posteriors (mixture of Gaussians) coming from different Variational Bayesian Monte 
    Carlo (VBMC) runs. It does so by optimizing the 'stacked ELBO' with respect to (w.r.t.) only 
    the weights of each Gaussian component of the 'stacked posterior'.

    Initialize a ``SVBMC`` object to set up the inference problem, then run
    ``optimize()``. 
    The initialization automatically filters out VBMC runs where:
        1- The algorithm has not converged;
        2- The algorith has converged poorly, with excessive uncertainty associated with at least one
        of the components of the expected log-joint.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    vp_list : list
        A list of ``VariationalPosterior`` (vp) objects output by VBMC 
        (see https://github.com/acerbilab/pyvbmc/tree/main for details)
    s_max : float
        A tolerance bound for the maximum standard deviation associated with individual components 
        of the expected log-joint `I_sk` (these values are specified within the ``VariationalPosterior`` 
        objects in `vp_list`). If a VBMC run has any `I_sk` with associated standard deviation >= `s_max`, 
        the whole run is considered poorly converged and discarded. Defaults to sqrt(5).
    M_min : int | float
        The minimum number (if `int` and > 1) or proportion (if `float` and <= 1) of VBMC runs to be used for S-VBMC. 
        If the number of well-converged runs is below this value, an error is produced. Defaults to 2/3. 
        **NOTE**: a value of exactly 1 is going to be interpreted as a PROPOTION (100% of runs), not as a number of runs. 
    testing: bool
        Whether you are performing unit tests or not. If set to `True`, the sampling for `stacked_entropy()`
        will be deterministic. In practice this slows down the optimization and overfits noise, so it 
        should always be kept to `False` outside of testing.

        Monte Carlo estimate of the mixture entropy for `K_total` components, 
        differentiable w.r.t. the mixture weights. 
        The individual VBMC posteriors exist in different "transformed" feature 
        spaces (because of variational whitening), so Jacobian corrections need 
        to be applied (and stored to be applied to the expected log-joint as well). 

        This works in the following steps:

        1- n_samples samples are taken from each Gaussian component (in the corresponding VBMC 
        posterior transformed space) of the stacked posterior, and transformed into the original 
        feature space (the individual vp objects have a built-in method for this);
        2- for each component of the stacked posterior, ALL samples are transformed into that 
        component's feature space, the corresponding Jacobian correction is computed and the log probability 
        of all the (`K_total`*`n_samples` = `S`) samples FOR THAT SPECIFIC COMPONENT is taken and stored;
        3- the log probability of each sample FOR THE WHOLE POSTERIOR is calculated, and these are 
        then averaged to obtain an estimate of the stacked entropy.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        w: torch.Tensor
